objective	In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions.
background	The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function.
background	This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient.
method	To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy.
result	We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.

background	While recent literature has partly advanced our understanding of mobile application business models, less attention has been given to identify the most successful business model especially in the game area.
objective	In this vein, this paper presents a comparative analysis of six Iranian android games in an app store “Iran Apps” which were top level games in terms of download and rate during a 3-month study.
result	The results reveal that freemium and In-app purchase models were more successful, while advertising model can be efficiently used as a complementary model.
result	This provides valuable insight into why some mobile applications are more successful than others.

background	Previous research has demonstrated that the experience of reading e-books is not equivalent to reading textbooks.
background	This study examines factors influencing preference for e-books as well as reported use of e-book content.
background	Although the present student cohort is the most technologically savvy to ever enter universities, students do not prefer e-books over textbooks regardless of their gender, computer use or comfort with computers.
background	No significant correlations existed between the number of e-books previously used and overall preference of e-books: Participants who had previously used an e-book still preferred print texts for learning.
background	Despite the ability to easily access supplemental content through e-books via hyperlinks and other features, students were more likely to use special features in print books than in e-books.

background	Spiking Neuron Networks (SNNs) are often referred to as the 3rd generation of neural networks.
background	Highly inspired from natural computing in the brain and recent advances in neurosciences, they derive their strength and interest from an accurate modeling of synaptic interactions between neurons, taking into account the time of spike firing.

background	Credit card plays a very important rule in today's economy.
background	It becomes an unavoidable part of household, business and global activities.
background	Although using credit cards provides enormous benefits when used carefully and responsibly,significant credit and financial damagesmay be causedby fraudulent activities.
background	Many techniques have been proposed to confront thegrowthin credit card fraud.
background	However, all of these techniques have the same goal of avoiding the credit card fraud; each one has its own drawbacks, advantages and characteristics.
objective	In this paper, after investigating difficultiesof credit card fraud detection, we seek to review the state of the art in credit card fraud detection techniques, datasets and evaluation criteria.

objective	In this paper, we propose a novel method for image inpainting based on a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).
method	We define a loss function consisting of two parts: (1) a contextual loss that preserves similarity between the input corrupted image and the recovered image, and (2) a perceptual loss that ensures a perceptually realistic output image.
method	Given a corrupted image with missing values, we use back-propagation on this loss to map the corrupted image to a smaller latent space.
method	The mapped vector is then passed through the generative model to predict the missing content.
result	The proposed framework is evaluated on the CelebA and SVHN datasets for two challenging inpainting tasks with random 80% corruption and large blocky corruption.
result	Experiments show that our method can successfully predict semantic information in the missing region and achieve pixel-level photorealism, which is impossible by almost all existing methods.

background	Distant supervision for relation extraction is an efficient method to scale relation extraction to very large corpora which contains thousands of relations.
background	However, the existing approaches have flaws on selecting valid instances and lack of background knowledge about the entities.
method	In this paper, we propose a sentence-level attention model to select the valid instances, which makes full use of the supervision information from knowledge bases.
method	And we extract entity descriptions from Freebase and Wikipedia pages to supplement background knowledge for our task.
result	The background knowledge not only provides more information for predicting relations, but also brings better entity representations for the attention module.
result	We conduct three experiments on a widely used dataset and the experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the baseline systems significantly.

background	Increasing use of the World Wide Web as a B2C commercial tool raises interest in understanding the key issues in building relationships with customers on the Internet.
background	Trust is believed to be the key to these relationships.
background	Given the differences between a virtual and a conventional marketplace, antecedents and consequences of trust merit re-examination.
objective	This research identifies a number of key factors related to trust in the B2C context and proposes a framework based on a series of underpinning relationships among these factors.
objective	The findings in this research suggest that people are more likely to purchase from the web if they perceive a higher degree of trust in e-commerce and have more experience in using the web.
result	Customer’s trust levels are likely to be influenced by the level of perceived market orientation, site quality, technical trustworthiness, and user’s web experience.
method	People with a higher level of perceived site quality seem to have a higher level of perceived market orientation and trustworthiness towards e-commerce.
method	Furthermore, people with a higher level of trust in e-commerce are more likely to participate in e-commerce.
method	Positive ‘word of mouth’, money back warranty and partnerships with well-known business partners, rank as the top three effective risk reduction tactics.
result	These findings complement the previous findings on e-commerce and shed light on how to establish a trust relationship on the World Wide Web.

background	Most of a cell’s functional processes involve interactions among proteins, and a key challenge in proteomics is to better understand these complex interaction graphs at a systems level.
background	Because of their importance in development and disease, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been the subject of intense research in recent years.
background	In addition, a greater understanding of PPIs can be achieved through the detailed investigation of the protein domain interactions which mediate PPIs.
background	In this chapter, we describe recent efforts to predict interactions between proteins and between protein domains.
method	We also describe methods that attempt to use protein interaction data to infer protein function.
method	Protein-protein interactions directly contribute to protein functions, and implications about functions can often be made via PPI studies.
background	These inferences are based on the premise that the function of a protein may be discovered by studying its interaction with one or more proteins of known functions.
result	The second part of this chapter reviews recent computational approaches to predict protein functions from PPI networks.

background	Pose Machines provide a sequential prediction framework for learning rich implicit spatial models.
objective	In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation.
objective	The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation.
method	We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference.
method	Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure.
result	We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets.

background	This paper presents a new algorithm to implement causal ordering.
background	Causal ordering was first proposed in the ISIS system developed at Cornell University.
method	The interest of causal ordering in a distr ibuted system is that it is cheaper to realize than total ordering.
method	The implementation of causal ordering proposed in this paper uses logical clocks of Mat te rn-Fidge (which define a partial order between events in a distr ibuted system) and presents two advantages over the implementation in ISIS: (1) the information added to messages to ensure causal ordering is bounded by the number of sites in the system, and (2) no special protocol is needed to dispose of this added information when it has become useless.
result	The implementation of ISIS presents however advantages in the case of site failures.

objective	In this paper, we examine a number of SQL and socalled "NoSQL" data stores designed to scale simple OLTP-style application loads over many servers.
method	Originally motivated by Web 2.0 applications, these systems are designed to scale to thousands or millions of users doing updates as well as reads, in contrast to traditional DBMSs and data warehouses.
method	We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions.
result	These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.

background	The wealth of social information presented on Facebook is astounding.
background	While these affordances allow users to keep up-to-date, they also produce a basis for social comparison and envy on an unprecedented scale.
background	Even though envy may endanger users’ life satisfaction and lead to platform avoidance, no study exists uncovering this dynamics.
background	To close this gap, we build on responses of 584 Facebook users collected as part of two independent studies.
background	In study 1, we explore the scale, scope, and nature of envy incidents triggered by Facebook.
objective	In study 2, the role of envy feelings is examined as a mediator between intensity of passive following on Facebook and users’ life satisfaction.
method	Confirming full mediation, we demonstrate that passive following exacerbates envy feelings, which decrease life satisfaction.
result	From a provider’s perspective, our findings signal that users frequently perceive Facebook as a stressful environment, which may, in the long-run, endanger platform sustainability.

background	Speech separation is the task of separating target speech from background interference.
result	Traditionally, speech separation is studied as a signal processing problem.
background	A more recent approach formulates speech separation as a supervised learning problem, where the discriminative patterns of speech, speakers, and background noise are learned from training data.
objective	Over the past decade, many supervised separation algorithms have been put forward.
method	In particular, the recent introduction of deep learning to supervised speech separation has dramatically accelerated progress and boosted separation performance.
result	This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research on deep learning based supervised speech separation in the last several years.
method	We first introduce the background of speech separation and the formulation of supervised separation.
method	Then, we discuss three main components of supervised separation: learning machines, training targets, and acoustic features.
objective	Much of the overview is on separation algorithms where we review monaural methods, including speech enhancement speech-nonspeech separation, speaker separation multitalker separation, and speech dereverberation, as well as multimicrophone techniques.
method	The important issue of generalization, unique to supervised learning, is discussed.

background	This paper presents a new feature extraction algorithm for the challenging problem of the classification of myoelectric signals for prostheses control.
background	The algorithm employs the orientation between a set of descriptors of muscular activities and a nonlinearly mapped version of them.
background	It incorporates information about the Electromyogram (EMG) signal power spectrum characteristics derived from each analysis window while correlating that with the descriptors of previous windows for robust activity recognition.
objective	The proposed idea can be summarized in the following three steps: 1) extract power spectrum moments from the current analysis window and its nonlinearly scaled version in time-domain through Fourier transform relations, 2) compute the orientation between the two sets of moments, and 3) apply data fusion on the resulting orientation features for the current and previous time windows and use the result as the final feature set.
result	EMG data collected from nine transradial amputees performing six classes of movements with different force levels is used to validate the proposed features.
result	When compared to other well-known EMG feature extraction methods, the proposed features produced an improvement of at least 4%.

background	Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite.
method	We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author.
method	We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm.
method	We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine learning techniques and human judges on this task.
result	Perhaps unsurprisingly, neither the human judges nor the machine learning techniques perform very well.

background	This paper presents a consensus model in group decision making under linguistic assessments.
background	It is based on the use of linguistic preferences to provide individuals' opinions, and on the use of fuzzy majority of consensus, represented by means of a linguistic quantifier.
method	Several linguistic consensus degrees and linguistic distances are defined, acting on three levels.
method	The consensus degrees indicate how far a group of individuals is from the maximum consensus, and linguistic distances indicate how far each individual is from current consensus labels over the preferences.
result	This consensus model allows to incorporate more human consistency in decision support systems.

background	Mobile business is a young promising industry created by the emergence of wireless data networks.
background	Similar to other emerging industries, it is characterized by a large number of uncertainties at different levels, in particular concerning technology, business strategy and consumer demand.
objective	This paper focuses on the strategic uncertainties, where a large number of actors are trying a number of strategic approaches to position themselves in the most favourable position in the value system.

objective	This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition.
method	We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation.
method	Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process.
method	Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations.
method	Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible.
result	Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99 % recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations.
result	The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition.
method	In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition.
other	The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html ).

background	Words have only one purpose in a technical context–the transmission of information.
background	When they fail to do that, they lead to confusion and misunderstanding.
method	"Distributed data processing" and "distributed processing" are two phrases which illustrate that axiom.

background	Generative Adversarial Networks have emerged as an effective technique for estimating data distributions.
objective	The basic setup consists of two deep networks playing against each other in a zero-sum game setting.
objective	However, it is not understood if the networks reach an equilibrium eventually and what dynamics makes this possible.
method	The current GAN training procedure, which involves simultaneous gradient descent, lacks a clear game-theoretic justification in the literature.
method	In this paper, we introduce regret minimization as a technique to reach equilibrium in games and use this to motivate the use of simultaneous GD in GANs.
result	In addition, we present a hypothesis that mode collapse, which is a common occurrence in GAN training, happens due to the existence of spurious local equilibria in non-convex games.
result	Motivated by these insights, we develop an algorithm called DRAGAN that is fast, simple to implement and achieves competitive performance in a stable fashion across different architectures, datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA), and divergence measures with almost no hyperparameter tuning.

background	Blendshapes”, a simple linear model of facial expression, is the prevalent approach to realistic facial animation.

background	The blendshape approach originated in industry, and became a subject of academic research relatively recently.
method	This course describes the published state of the art in this area, covering both literature from the graphics research community, and developments published in industry forums.
method	We show that, despite the simplicity of the blendshape approach, there remain open problems associated with this fundamental technique.

objective	This paper investigates the popular neural word embedding method Word2vec as a source of evidence in document ranking.
method	In contrast to NLP applications of word2vec, which tend to use only the input embeddings, we retain both the input and the output embeddings, allowing us to calculate a different word similarity that may be more suitable for document ranking.
method	We map the query words into the input space and the document words into the output space, and compute a relevance score by aggregating the cosine similarities across all the query-document word pairs.
method	We postulate that the proposed Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) provides evidence that a document is about a query term, in addition to and complementing the traditional term frequency based approach.

background	Social media is bringing great challenges and wonderful opportunities for organizational learning.
method	With support of social media, organizations may facilitate the knowledge management process within firms (e.g., knowledge sharing), then to encourage employees to promote collaborative learning behaviors from e-learning to social learning.
method	There is a significant trend in the recent studies is increasing number of publications on social media supported knowledge management (SMKM).
background	However, previous SMKM studies have not been depicted well by combining work of both researchers in social media study and ones in KM (which supports organizational learning) study.
objective	By using CiteSpace, this paper mapped important references that lead trends of SMKM development, authors contributing greatly to this field and hot topics of all the related articles.
method	The way that SMKM study developed was analyzed according to the visualization of references and topics.
method	Furthermore, the two most important groups – topics from SM and those from KM study were studied respectively to compare their development in order to show the fusion, the separation and other relationship.
method	Finally, hottest trends and topics in these years and recent future were discussed to provide help for future work.

background	Scalable and effective exploration remains a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL).
background	While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the setting of discrete state and action spaces, these methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional deep RL scenarios.
background	As such, most contemporary RL relies on simple heuristics such as -greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise to the controls.
objective	This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent’s belief of environment dynamics.
method	We propose a practical implementation, using variational inference in Bayesian neural networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces.
method	VIME modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms.
result	We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse rewards.

background	A common way of dynamically scheduling jobs in a manufacturing system is by implementing dispatching rules.
method	The issues with this method are that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment and also that no “ideal” single rule exists for all the possible states that the system may be in.
method	Therefore, it would be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule for each instance.
method	To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach that uses machine learning can be used.
method	Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time.
result	In this paper, a literature review of the main machine learning based scheduling approaches from the last decade is presented.

background	The linear combination of forecasts is a procedure that has improved the forecasting accuracy for different time series.
background	In this procedure, each method being combined is associated to a numerical weight that indicates the contribution of the method in the combined forecast.
method	We present the use of machine learning techniques to define the weights for the linear combination of forecasts.
method	In this paper, a machine learning technique uses features of the series at hand to define the adequate weights for a pre-defined number of forecasting methods.

background	This paper presents a survey on the current state-of-the-art in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Operating Systems (OSs).
background	In recent years, WSNs have received tremendous attention in the research community, with applications in battlefields, industrial process monitoring, home automation, and environmental monitoring, to name but a few.
background	A WSN is a highly dynamic network because nodes die due to severe environmental conditions and battery power depletion.
background	Furthermore, a WSN is composed of miniaturized motes equipped with scarce resources e.g., limited memory and computational abilities.
background	WSNs invariably operate in an unattended mode and in many scenarios it is impossible to replace sensor motes after deployment, therefore a fundamental objective is to optimize the sensor motes' life time.
background	These characteristics of WSNs impose additional challenges on OS design for WSN, and consequently, OS design for WSN deviates from traditional OS design.
objective	The purpose of this survey is to highlight major concerns pertaining to OS design in WSNs and to point out strengths and weaknesses of contemporary OSs for WSNs, keeping in mind the requirements of emerging WSN applications.
method	The state-of-the-art in operating systems for WSNs has been examined in terms of the OS Architecture, Programming Model, Scheduling, Memory Management and Protection, Communication Protocols, Resource Sharing, Support for Real-Time Applications, and additional features.
result	These features are surveyed for both real-time and non-real-time WSN operating systems.

background	Biham and Kocher demonstrated that the PKZIP stream cipher was weak and presented an attack requiring thirteen bytes of plaintext.
background	The deflate algorithm “zippers” now use to compress the plaintext before encryption makes it difficult to get known plaintext.
method	We consider the problem of reducing the amount of known plaintext by finding other ways to filter key guesses.
method	In most cases we can reduce the amount of known plaintext from the archived file to two or three bytes, depending on the zipper used and the number of files in the archive.
method	For the most popular zippers on the Internet, there is a fast attack that does not require any information about the files in the archive; instead, it gets doubly-encrypted plaintext by exploiting a weakness in the pseudorandom-number generator.

background	The negative consequences of cyberbullying are becoming more alarming every day and technical solutions that allow for taking appropriate action by means of automated detection are still very limited.

method	In this paper we show that taking user context into account improves the detection of cyberbullying.

background	The 1990s saw the emergence of cognitive models that depend on very high dimensionality and randomness.
background	They include Holographic Reduced Representations, Spatter Code, Semantic Vectors, Latent Semantic Analysis, Context-Dependent Thinning, and Vector-Symbolic Architecture.
objective	They represent things in high-dimensional vectors that are manipulated by operations that produce new high-dimensional vectors in the style of traditional computing, in what is called here hyperdimensional computing on account of the very high dimensionality.
method	The paper presents the main ideas behind these models, written as a tutorial essay in hopes of making the ideas accessible and even provocative.
method	A sketch of how we have arrived at these models, with references and pointers to further reading, is given at the end.
result	The thesis of the paper is that hyperdimensional representation has much to offer to students of cognitive science, theoretical neuroscience, computer science and engineering, and mathematics.

background	A new, simple, and symmetric algorithm can be implemented that results in higher levels of detail in solid objects than previously possible with autostereograms.
background	In a stereoscope, an optical instrument similar to binoculars, each eye views a different picture and thereby receives the specific image that would have arisen naturally.
background	An early suggestion for a color stereo computer display involved a rotating filter wheel held in front of the eyes.
method	In contrast, this article describes a method for viewing on paper or on an ordinary computer screen without special equipment, although it is limited to the display of 3D monochromatic objects.
method	(The image can be colored, say, for artistic reasons, but the method we describe does not allow colors to be allocated in a way that corresponds to an arbitrary coloring of the solid object depicted.)
result	The image can easily be constructed by computer from any 3D scene or solid object description.<<ETX>>

background	This paper presents a simulated memristor crossbar implementation of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
background	In the past few years deep neural networks implemented on GPU clusters have become the state of the art in image classification.
background	They provide excellent classification ability at the cost of a more complex data manipulation process.
method	However once these systems are trained, we show that the analog crossbar circuits in this paper can highly parallelize the recognition phase of a CNN algorithm.
method	One of the drawbacks of using memristors to carry out computations is that the data stored will likely have less precision when compared to typical 32-bit floating point memory.
method	However, we show the proposed system is capable of operating with zero loss in classification accuracy if the memristors utilized are able to store at least 16 unique values (essentially acting as 4-bit devices).
result	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents a memristor based circuit for implementing CNN recognition.
result	This is also the first paper that provides a circuit for precise memristor based analog convolution.

method	As the DNN performs a mapping from the input space to the output space through many layers sequentially, we define the distilled knowledge to be transferred in terms of flow between layers, which is calculated by computing the inner product between features from two layers.
method	When we compare the student DNN and the original network with the same size as the student DNN but trained without a teacher network, the proposed method of transferring the distilled knowledge as the flow between two layers exhibits three important phenomena: (1) the student DNN that learns the distilled knowledge is optimized much faster than the original model, (2) the student DNN outperforms the original DNN, and (3) the student DNN can learn the distilled knowledge from a teacher DNN that is trained at a different task, and the student DNN outperforms the original DNN that is trained from scratch.

background	We propose the use of dimensionality reduction as a defense against evasion attacks on ML classifiers.
background	We present and investigate a strategy for incorporating dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis to enhance the resilience of machine learning, targeting both the classification and the training phase.
result	We empirically evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of dimensionality reduction of data as a defense mechanism against evasion attacks using multiple real-world datasets.
result	Our key findings are that the defenses are (i) effective against strategic evasion attacks in the literature, increasing the resources required by an adversary for a successful attack by a factor of about two, (ii) applicable across a range of ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, and (iii) generalizable to multiple application domains, including image classification, and human activity classification.

background	Lane detection is to detect lanes on the road and provide the accurate location and shape of each lane.
background	It severs as one of the key techniques to enable modern assisted and autonomous driving systems.
method	However, several unique properties of lanes challenge the detection methods.
method	The lack of distinctive features makes lane detection algorithms tend to be confused by other objects with similar local appearance.
method	Moreover, the inconsistent number of lanes on a road as well as diverse lane line patterns, e.g. solid, broken, single, double, merging, and splitting lines further hamper the performance.
method	In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based method, named LaneNet, to break down the lane detection into two stages: lane edge proposal and lane line localization.
method	Stage one uses a lane edge proposal network for pixel-wise lane edge classification, and the lane line localization network in stage two then detects lane lines based on lane edge proposals.
method	Please note that the goal of our LaneNet is built to detect lane line only, which introduces more difficulties on suppressing the false detections on the similar lane marks on the road like arrows and characters.
method	Despite all the difficulties, our lane detection is shown to be robust to both highway and urban road scenarios method without relying on any assumptions on the lane number or the lane line patterns.
result	The high running speed and low computational cost endow our LaneNet the capability of being deployed on vehicle-based systems.

background	Generative models, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs), have gained significant attention in recent years.
background	A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications.
background	Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task.
background	While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison.
background	As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field.

background	Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the notoriously difficult problem known as “the curse of dimensionality”.
objective	This paper presents a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs.
background	To this end, the PDEs are reformulated as a control theory problem and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function.
result	Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and speed.
result	This opens up new possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their inter-relationships.

background	The mutual orthogonality among the received signals is often assumed but cannot be achieved in practice for all Doppler and delay pairs.
method	We introduce a data model considering the correlation among the data from different transmitter-receiver pairs as unknown parameters.
method	Based on the expectation maximization algorithm, we propose a method to estimate the target, correlation, and noise parameters.
method	We then use the estimates of these parameters to develop a statistical decision test.
method	Employing the asymptotic statistical characteristics and the numerical performance of the test, we analyze the sensitivity of the MIMO radar with respect to changes in the cross-correlation levels of the measurements.

background	Interest in human-robot coexistence, in which humans and robots share a common work volume, is increasing in manufacturing environments.
background	Efficient work coordination requires both awareness of the human pose and a plan of action for both human and robot agents in order to compute robot motion trajectories that synchronize naturally with human motion.
objective	In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that synthesizes anticipatory knowledge of both human motions and subsequent action steps in order to predict in real-time the intended target of a human performing a reaching motion.
method	Motion-level anticipatory models are constructed using multiple demonstrations of human reaching motions.
method	We produce a library of motions from human demonstrations, based on a statistical representation of the degrees of freedom of the human arm, using time series analysis, wherein each time step is encoded as a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
method	We demonstrate the benefits of this approach through offline statistical analysis of human motion data.
result	The results indicate a considerable improvement over prior techniques in early prediction, achieving 70% or higher correct classification on average for the first third of the trajectory (<; 500msec).
method	We also indicate proof-of-concept through the demonstration of a human-robot cooperative manipulation task performed with a PR2 robot.
background	Finally, we analyze the quality of task-level anticipatory knowledge required to improve prediction performance early in the human motion trajectory.

background	Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest.
background	Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events.
background	Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments.
background	Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research.
background	Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA).
background	The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company.
objective	Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis.
method	The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets.
objective	In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets.
method	In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase.

background	Even the support vector machine (SVM) has been proposed to provide a good generalization performance, the classification result of the practically implemented SVM is often far from the theoretically expected level because their implementations are based on the approximated algorithms due to the high complexity of time and space.
method	To improve the limited classification performance of the real SVM, we propose to use the SVM ensembles with bagging (bootstrap aggregating).
method	Each individual SVM is trained independently using the randomly chosen training samples via a bootstrap technique.
method	Then, they are aggregated into to make a collective decision in several ways such as the majority voting, the LSE(least squares estimation)-based weighting, and the double-layer hierarchical combining.
result	Various simulation results for the IRIS data classification and the hand-written digit recognitionshow that the proposed SVM ensembles with bagging outperforms a single SVM in terms of classification accuracy greatly.

background	Most pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) scale poorly to massively parallel high-performance computation because they are designed as sequentially dependent state transformations.
background	We demonstrate that independent, keyed transformations of counters produce a large alternative class of PRNGs with excellent statistical properties (long period, no discernable structure or correlation).
method	These counter-based PRNGs are ideally suited to modern multi-core CPUs, GPUs, clusters, and special-purpose hardware because they vectorize and parallelize well, and require little or no memory for state.
method	We introduce several counter-based PRNGs: some based on cryptographic standards (AES, Threefish) and some completely new (Philox).
result	All our PRNGs pass rigorous statistical tests (including TestU01's BigCrush) and produce at least 264 unique parallel streams of random numbers, each with period 2128 or more.
result	In addition to essentially unlimited parallel scalability, our PRNGs offer excellent single-chip performance: Philox is faster than the CURAND library on a single NVIDIA GPU.

background	The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain.
background	Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models.
background	Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing.
background	However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective.
background	The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level.
background	Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth.

background	We present a novel clustering algorithm for tagging a face dataset (e. g., a personal photo album).
result	The core of the algorithm is a new dissimilarity, called Rank-Order distance, which measures the dissimilarity between two faces using their neighboring information in the dataset.
method	The Rank-Order distance is motivated by an observation that faces of the same person usually share their top neighbors.
method	Specifically, for each face, we generate a ranking order list by sorting all other faces in the dataset by absolute distance (e. g., L1 or L2 distance between extracted face recognition features).
method	Then, the Rank-Order distance of two faces is calculated using their ranking orders.
method	Using the new distance, a Rank-Order distance based clustering algorithm is designed to iteratively group all faces into a small number of clusters for effective tagging.
result	The proposed algorithm outperforms competitive clustering algorithms in term of both precision/recall and efficiency.

background	We introduce a novel approach to automatically recover 3D human pose from a single image.
background	Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3D pose.
method	Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly.
method	In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2D detection and the 3D inference problems.
method	For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms.
result	Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, and the ability of our methodology to provide accurate 2D and 3D pose estimations even when the 2D detectors are inaccurate.

background	A document image is composed of a variety of physical entities or regions such as text blocks, lines, words, figures, tables, and background.
background	We could also assign functional or logical labels such as sentences, titles, captions, author names, and addresses to some of these regions.
method	The process of document structure and layout analysis tries to decompose a given document image into its component regions and understand their functional roles and relationships.
method	The processing is carried out in multiple steps, such as preprocessing, page decomposition, structure understanding, etc.
objective	We will look into each of these steps in detail in the following sections.
method	Document images are often generated from physical documents by digitization using scanners or digital cameras.
result	Many documents, such as newspapers, magazines and brochures, contain very complex layout due to the placement of figures, titles, and captions, complex backgrounds, artistic text formatting, etc.

result	A human reader uses a variety of additional cues such as context, conventions and information about language/script, along with a complex reasoning process to decipher the contents of a document.
result	Automatic analysis of an arbitrary document with complex layout is an extremely difficult task and is beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art document structure and layout analysis systems.

background	Modern NAND flash memory chips provide high density by storing two bits of data in each flash cell, called a multi-level cell (MLC).
background	An MLC partitions the threshold voltage range of a flash cell into four voltage states.
background	When a flash cell is programmed, a high voltage is applied to the cell.
background	Due to parasitic capacitance coupling between flash cells that are physically close to each other, flash cell programming can lead to cell-to-cell program interference, which introduces errors into neighboring flash cells.
method	In order to reduce the impact of cell-to-cell interference on the reliability of MLC NAND flash memory, flash manufacturers adopt a two-step programming method, which programs the MLC in two separate steps.
method	First, the flash memory partially programs the least significant bit of the MLC to some intermediate threshold voltage.
result	Second, it programs the most significant bit to bring the MLC up to its full voltage state.
result	In this paper, we demonstrate that two-step programming exposes new reliability and security vulnerabilities.
method	We experimentally characterize the effects of two-step programming using contemporary 1X-nm (i.e., 15–19nm) flash memory chips.
result	We find that a partially-programmed flash cell (i.e., a cell where the second programming step has not yet been performed) is much more vulnerable to cell-to-cell interference and read disturb than a fully-programmed cell.

background	In many practical learning scenarios, there is a small amount of labeled data along with a large pool of unlabeled data.
background	Many supervised learning algorithms have been developed and extensively studied.
method	We present a new \co-training" strategy for using un-labeled data to improve the performance of standard supervised learning algorithms.
method	Unlike much of the prior work, such as the co-training procedure of Blum and Mitchell (1998), we do not assume there are two redundant views both of which are suucient for classiication.
method	The only requirement our co-training strategy places on each supervised learning algorithm is that its hypothesis partitions the example space into a set of equivalence classes (e.g. for a decision tree each leaf deenes an equivalence class).
result	We evaluate our co-training strategy via experiments using data from the UCI repository.

background	Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful.
background	Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function.
background	However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process.
method	To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator.
method	We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence.
background	There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs.
background	First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs.
background	Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process.
result	We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.
result	We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.

background	Our daily lives have been immersed in widespread location-based social networks (LBSNs).
background	As an open platform, LBSNs typically allow all kinds of users to register accounts.
background	Malicious attackers can easily join and post misleading information, often with the intention of influencing users' decisions in urban computing environments.
method	To provide reliable information and improve the experience for legitimate users, we design and implement DeepScan, a malicious account detection system for LBSNs.
method	Different from existing approaches, DeepScan leverages emerging deep learning technologies to learn users' dynamic behavior.
method	In particular, we introduce the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct time series analysis of user activities.
method	DeepScan combines newly introduced time series features and a set of conventional features extracted from user activities, and exploits a supervised machine-learning-based model for detection.
result	Using real traces collected from Dianping, a representative LBSN, we demonstrate that DeepScan can achieve excellent prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.964.
result	We also find that the time series features play a critical role in the detection system.

background	Introduction: While increased time spent on social media (TSSM) has been associated with depression and anxiety, the independent role of using multiple social media (SM) platforms is unclear.
method	Methods: We surveyed a nationally-representative sample of 1787 U.S. young adults ages 19e32.
method	Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).
result	We assessed use of multiple SM platforms with an adapted Pew Internet Research scale.
method	We used ordered logistic regression models to assess associations between use of multiple SM platforms and mental health outcomes while controlling for eight covariates, including overall TSSM.
result	Results: Compared to those who used 0e2 social media platforms, participants who used 7e11 social media platforms had substantially higher odds of having increased levels of both depression (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1⁄4 3.0, 95% CI 1⁄4 1.9e4.8) and anxiety symptoms (AOR 1⁄4 3.2, 95% CI 1⁄4 2.0e5.1).
result	Associations were linear (p < 0.001 for all) and robust to all sensitivity analyses.
result	Conclusions: Use of multiple SM platforms is independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, even when controlling for overall TSSM.
result	These associations are strong enough that it may be valuable for clinicians to ask individuals with depression and anxiety about multiple platform use and to counsel regarding this potential contributing factor.

background	Model interpretation is one of the key aspects of the model evaluation process.
background	The explanation of the relationship between model variables and outputs is easy for statistical models, such as linear regressions, thanks to the availability of model parameters and their statistical significance.

background	The Internet of Things is one of the most promising technological developments in information technology.
background	It promises huge financial and nonfinancial benefits across supply chains, in product life cycle and customer relationship applications as well as in smart environments.
background	However, the adoption process of the Internet of Things has been slower than expected.
background	One of the main reasons for this is the missing profitability for each individual stakeholder.
background	Costs and benefits are not equally distributed.
method	Cost benefit sharing models have been proposed to overcome this problem and to enable new areas of application.
method	However, these cost benefit sharing approaches are complex, time consuming, and have failed to achieve broad usage.
method	In this chapter, an alternative concept, suggesting flexible pricing and trading of information, is proposed.
method	On the basis of a beverage supply chain scenario, a prototype installation, based on an open source billing solution and the Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS), is shown as a proof of concept and an introduction to different pricing options.
method	This approach allows a more flexible and scalable solution for cost benefit sharing and may enable new business models for the Internet of Things.

background	The after-sales activities are nowadays acknowledged as a relevant source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most manufacturing industries.
method	Top and middle management, therefore, should focus on the definition of a structured business performance measurement system for the after-sales business.
objective	In addition, since many actors are involved along the after-sale service supply chain, an integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be designed consistently at every level of the supply chain.
background	Nonetheless, little attention was devoted by scientific and managerial literature to this topic.
method	The paper aims at filling this gap, and proposes an integrated framework for the after-sales network performance measurement, and provides an empirical application to two automotive case companies and their official service network.
result	The cases show that performance measurement systems of different supply chain actors should be aligned in order to achieve strategic consistency.
result	In particular, the performance of different actors at the process level of the framework concurs in determining the after-sales service overall performance towards the final customer.
result	In addition, linkages at other levels (mainly the business and activity ones) may be needed or helpful in ensuring consistency between strategic and operational objectives, inside the organisations and thus for the whole supply chain.

objective	This paper proposes to use autoencoders with nonlinear dimensionality reduction in the anomaly detection task.
method	The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an autoencoder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA and kernel PCA to clarify its property.
method	The artificial data is generated from Lorenz system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data.
method	This paper demonstrates that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails.
method	Also, autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising autoenconders.
method	Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as nonlinear techniques without complex computation as kernel PCA requires.
result	Finaly, the authors examine the learned features in the hidden layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly and activate differently with anomalous input.

background	Ties often have a strength naturally associated with them that differentiate them from each other.
background	Tie strength has been operationalized as weights.
objective	A few network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of node centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness.
objective	However, these generalizations have solely focused on tie weights, and not on the number of ties, which was the central component of the original measures.
objective	This paper proposes generalizations that combine both these aspects.
method	We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying one of them to Freeman’s EIES dataset.

background	Online taxicab platforms like DiDi and Uber have impacted hundreds of millions of users on their choices of traveling, but how do users feel about the ride-sharing services, and how to improve their experience?
background	While current ride-sharing services have collected massive travel data, it remains challenging to develop data-driven techniques for modeling and predicting user ride experience.
objective	In this work, we aim to accurately predict passenger satisfaction over their rides and understand the key factors that lead to good/bad experiences.
method	Based on in-depth analysis of large-scale travel data from a popular taxicab platform in China, we develop PHINE (Pattern-aware Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding) for data-driven user experience modeling.
method	Our PHINE framework is novel in that it is composed of spatial-temporal node binding and grouping for addressing the inherent data variation, and pattern preservation based joint training for modeling the interactions among drivers, passengers, locations, and time.
result	Extensive experiments on 12 real-world travel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PHINE over strong baseline methods.

background	In some cases, pattern recognition algorithms for processing depth images can be tested using actual sensors observing real-world objects.
background	In many situations, however, it is common to test new algorithms using computer-generated synthetic images, as such simulations tend to be faster, more flexible, and less expensive than hardware tests.

background	This paper attempts to examine the effects of virtual team dimensions on social identities of its members.
method	A review of the literature shows that the geographically dispersed, culturally diverse as well as temporary dimensions of virtual teams do not match with their stability as members have different ethnic, social, or cultural backgrounds.
background	Sources like culture, place, and time seem to continuously acquire social identities.
method	Due to the importance of social identity, an attempt has been made to examine its influence on organizational variables (i.e. job satisfaction, job involvement, job commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior).
method	Questionnaire-based data have been accomplished from 149 members of 44 teams.
result	The hypothesized relationships among the proposed variables are tested via a structural equation model (SEM).
result	Results show that the geographically disperse and culturally diverse variables are negatively related to the social identity as against those of temporary and organizational variables which are related positively.

background	While favouring communications and easing information sharing, Social Network Sites are also used to launch harmful campaigns against specific groups and individuals.
background	Cyberbullism, incitement to self-harm practices, sexual predation are just some of the severe effects of massive online offensives.
background	Moreover, attacks can be carried out against groups of victims and can degenerate in physical violence.
objective	In this work, we aim at containing and preventing the alarming diffusion of such hate campaigns.
objective	Using Facebook as a benchmark, we consider the textual content of comments appeared on a set of public Italian pages.
method	We first propose a variety of hate categories to distinguish the kind of hate.
method	Crawled comments are then annotated by up to five distinct human annotators, according to the defined taxonomy.
method	Leveraging morpho-syntactical features, sentiment polarity and word embedding lexicons, we design and implement two classifiers for the Italian language, based on different learning algorithms: the first based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the second on a particular Recurrent Neural Network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
method	We test these two learning algorithms in order to verify their classification performances on the task of hate speech recognition.

background	In recent years two main platforms emerged as powerful key players in the domain of parallel computing: GPUs and FPGAs.
background	Many researches investigate interaction and benefits of coupling them with a general purpose processor (CPU), but very few, and only very recently, integrate the two in the same computational system.
background	Even less research are focusing on direct interaction of the two platforms [1].
objective	This paper presents an open source framework enabling easy integration of GPU and FPGA resources; Our work provides direct data transfer between the two platforms with minimal CPU coordination at high data rate and low latency.
objective	Finally, at the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposition of an open source implementation of a system including an FPGA and a GPU that provides code for both sides.

background	Instagram is a popular social networking application, which allows photo-sharing and applying different photo filters to adjust the appearance of a picture.
background	By applying photo filters, users are able to create a style that they want to express to their audience.
objective	In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users take pictures and apply filters to them.
method	To investigate this relationship, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API.
result	Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits.
result	Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and the way users want to make their pictures look.
result	This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.

result	Findings suggest that social media are predominantly used after holidays for experience sharing.
method	It is also shown that there is a strong correlation between perceived level of influence from social media and changes made in holiday plans prior to final decisions.

background	This paper provides new results for the tracking control of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
background	The UAV has four input degrees of freedom, namely the magnitudes of the four rotor thrusts, that are used to control the six translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and to achieve asymptotic tracking of four outputs, namely, three position variables for the vehicle center of mass and the direction of one vehicle body-fixed axis.
background	A globally defined model of the quadrotor UAV rigid body dynamics is introduced as a basis for the analysis.
method	A nonlinear tracking controller is developed on the special Euclidean group SE(3) and it is shown to have desirable closed loop properties that are almost global.
result	Several numerical examples, including an example in which the quadrotor recovers from being initially upside down, illustrate the versatility of the controller.

background	We consider the problem of learning a sparse multi-task regression, where the structure in the outputs can be represented as a tree with leaf nodes as outputs and internal nodes as clusters of the outputs at multiple granularity.
objective	Our goal is to recover the common set of relevant inputs for each output cluster.
background	Assuming that the tree structure is available as prior knowledge, we formulate this problem as a new multi-task regularized regression called tree-guided group lasso.
method	Our structured regularization is based on a grouplasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure.
method	We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap.
method	We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a largescale problem.
result	Using simulated and yeast datasets, we demonstrate that our method shows a superior performance in terms of both prediction errors and recovery of true sparsity patterns compared to other methods for multi-task learning.

background	While software is so important for all facets of the modern world, software development itself is not a perfect process.
method	Agile software engineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way of developing software as compared to the traditional methodologies.
result	However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in this subject is still scant in the academic circles.
method	This research study was a survey study on the critical success factors of Agile software development projects using quantitative approach.
method	Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential critical success factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled.
objective	Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted to consolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possible critical success factors for each of the four project success categories – Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost.
method	A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey data from 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world.
result	Multiple regression techniques were used, both at the full regression model and at the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure.
result	The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported, identifying three critical success factors for Agile software development projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile Software Engineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability.

background	In this work, we present a minimal neural model for constituency parsing based on independent scoring of labels and spans.
objective	We show that this model is not only compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of the input.
method	We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).

background	Autonomous vehicles capable of navigating unpredictable real-world environments with little human feedback are a reality today.
background	Such systems rely heavily on onboard sensors such as cameras, radar/LIDAR, and GPS as well as capabilities such as 3G/4G connectivity and V2V/V2I communication to make real-time maneuvering decisions.
background	Autonomous vehicle control imposes very strict requirements on the security of the communication channels used by the vehicle to exchange information as well as the control logic that performs complex driving tasks such as adapting vehicle velocity or changing lanes.
objective	This study presents a first look at the effects of security attacks on the communication channel as well as sensor tampering of a connected vehicle stream equipped to achieve CACC.
result	Our simulation results show that an insider attack can cause significant instability in the CACC vehicle stream.
result	We also illustrate how different countermeasures, such as downgrading to ACC mode, could potentially be used to improve the security and safety of the connected vehicle streams.

background	This paper presents a wall-climbing robot which adopts passive suction cups as the attaching components.
background	Using only one motor, this robot can not only move on a wall but also attach suction cups to the wall and remove them from the wall.
background	Passive suction cups do not consume additional energy to keep adhesion.
objective	Therefore, the proposed robot can realize the climbing motion on a wall with relatively low energy consumption.
method	The prototype has been designed, fabricated and tested.
result	The experiments showed that the proposed robot could attach and remove suction cups passively.
result	However, the robot could not move up the wall well and fell down often.
result	In order to solve this problem, the load of each suction cup when attached to a vertical wall is analyzed.
result	As a result, it is shown that a moment generated by both of the gravity and the attaching force of suction cups turns the robot down from the wall.
result	Then a new model which improves the falling problems is thus designed.

background	There is an ongoing debate over the activities of brands and companies in social media.
background	Some researchers believe social media provide a unique opportunity for brands to foster their relationships with customers, while others believe the contrary.
objective	Taking the perspective of the brand community building plus the brand trust and loyalty literatures, our goal is to show how brand communities based on social media influence elements of the customer centric model (i.e., the relationships among focal customer and brand, product, company, and other customers) and brand loyalty.
method	A survey-based empirical study with 441 respondents was conducted.
result	The results of structural equation modeling show that brand communities established on social media have positive effects on customer/product, customer/brand, customer/company and customer/other customers relationships, which in turn have positive effects on brand trust, and trust has positive effects on brand loyalty.
method	We find that brand trust has a fully mediating role in converting the effects of enhanced relationships in brand community to brand loyalty.
result	The implications for marketing practice and future research are discussed.

background	Process discovery—discovering a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log—is one of the most challenging tasks in process mining.
background	The primary reason is that conventional modeling languages (e.g., Petri nets, BPMN, EPCs, and ULM ADs) have difficulties representing the observed behavior properly and/or succinctly.
background	Moreover, discovered process models tend to have deadlocks and livelocks.
objective	Therefore, we advocate a new representation more suitable for process discovery: causal nets.
method	Causal nets are related to the representations used by several process discovery techniques (e.g., heuristic mining, fuzzy mining, and genetic mining).
method	However, unlike existing approaches, we provide declarative semantics more suitable for process mining.
method	To clarify these semantics and to illustrate the non-local nature of this new representation, we relate causal nets to Petri nets.

background	Resting state functional connectivity reveals intrinsic, spontaneous networks that elucidate the functional architecture of the human brain.
background	However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources.
method	We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data.
method	Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global signal.
method	The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity.
method	We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented fcMRI measures.
result	The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures.

background	Despite their massivesize, successful deep artificial neural networkscan exhibit a remarkably small differencebetween training and test performance.
background	Conventional wisdom attributessmall generalization error either to propertiesof themodel family, or to the regularization techniquesused during training.
objective	Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice.
method	Specifically, our experimentsestablish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data.
method	This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise.
result	We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simpledepth two neural networksalready haveperfect finitesampleexpressivity assoon as thenumber of parameters exceeds thenumber of datapointsas it usually does in practice.
result	We interpret our experimental findingsby comparison with traditional models.

background	Due to the increasing threat from malicious software (malware), monitoring of vulnerable systems is becoming increasingly important.
background	The need to log and analyze activity encompasses networks, individual computers, as well as mobile devices.
background	While there are various automatic approaches and techniques available to detect, identify, or capture malware, the actual analysis of the ever-increasing number of suspicious samples is a time-consuming process for malware analysts.
method	The use of visualization and highly interactive visual analytics systems can help to support this analysis process with respect to investigation, comparison, and summarization of malware samples.
background	Currently, there is no survey available that reviews available visualization systems supporting this important and emerging field.
objective	We provide a systematic overview and categorization of malware visualization systems from the perspective of visual analytics.
result	Additionally, we identify and evaluate data providers and commercial tools that produce meaningful input data for the reviewed malware visualization systems.
result	This helps to reveal data types that are currently underrepresented, enabling new research opportunities in the visualization community.

background	Building robust low and mid-level image representations, beyond edge primitives, is a long-standing goal in vision.
background	Many existing feature detectors spatially pool edge information which destroys cues such as edge intersections, parallelism and symmetry.
objective	We present a learning framework where features that capture these mid-level cues spontaneously emerge from image data.
method	Our approach is based on the convolutional decomposition of images under a spar-sity constraint and is totally unsupervised.
objective	By building a hierarchy of such decompositions we can learn rich feature sets that are a robust image representation for both the analysis and synthesis of images.

background	We have analyzed the properties of the HSV (Hue, Saturation and Value) color space with emphasis on the visual perception of the variation in Hue, Saturation and Intensity values of an image pixel.
method	We extract pixel features by either choosing the Hue or the Intensity as the dominant property based on the Saturation value of a pixel.
method	The feature extraction method has been applied for both image segmentation as well as histogram generation applications – two distinct approaches to content based image retrieval (CBIR).
method	Segmentation using this method shows better identification of objects in an image.
method	The histogram retains a uniform color transition that enables us to do a window-based smoothing during retrieval.
result	The results have been compared with those generated using the RGB color space.

result	Preliminary results demonstrate that Neural Turing Machines can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from input and output examples.

background	Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation.
background	This article investigates how content producers navigate ‘imagined audiences’ on Twitter.
method	We talked with participants who have different types of followings to understand their techniques, including targeting different audiences, concealing subjects, and maintaining authenticity.
background	Some techniques of audience management resemble the practices of ‘micro-celebrity’ and personal branding, both strategic self-commodification.

background	The ICP algorithm is accurate and fast for registration between two point sets in a same scale, but it doesn't handle the case with different scales.
objective	This paper instead introduces a novel approach named the scaling iterative closest point (SICP) algorithm which integrates a scale matrix with boundaries into the original ICP algorithm for scaling registration.
method	This method uses a simple iterative algorithm with the SVD algorithm and the properties of parabola incorporated to compute the translation, rotation and scale transformations at each iterative step, and its convergence is rapid with only a few iterations.
method	The SICP algorithm is independent of shape representation and feature extraction; thereby it is general for scaling registration.

background	Most of current computer-based facial expression analysis methods focus on the recognition of perfectly posed expressions, and hence are incapable of handling the individuals with expression impairments.
background	In particular, patients with schizophrenia usually have impaired expressions in the form of "flat" or "inappropriate" affects, which make the quantification of their facial expressions a challenging problem.
method	This paper presents methods to quantify the group differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, by extracting specialized features and analyzing group differences on a feature manifold.
method	The features include 2D and 3D geometric features, and the moment invariants combining both 3D geometry and 2D textures.
result	Facial expression recognition experiments on actors demonstrate that our combined features can better characterize facial expressions than either 2D geometric or texture features.
result	The features are then embedded into an ISOMAP manifold to quantify the group differences between controls and patients.
result	Experiments show that our results are strongly supported by the human rating results and clinical findings, thus providing a framework that is able to quantify the abnormality in patients with schizophrenia.

background	Many real-world sequence learning tasks require the prediction of sequences of labels from noisy, unsegmented input data.
background	In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units.
background	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks.
background	However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited.
method	This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems.
result	An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.

background	Top-performing deep architectures are trained on massive amounts of labeled data.
background	In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available.
background	Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled targetdomain data is necessary).
method	As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of “deep” features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains.
result	We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer.
method	The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation.
result	Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages.
result	The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-ofthe-art on Office datasets.

background	Smartphones have exploded in popularity in recent years, becoming ever more sophisticated and capable.
background	As a result, developers worldwide are building increasingly complex applications that require ever increasing amounts of computational power and energy.
objective	In this paper we propose ThinkAir, a framework that makes it simple for developers to migrate their smartphone applications to the cloud.
objective	ThinkAir exploits the concept of smartphone virtualization in the cloud and provides method-level computation offloading.
objective	Advancing on previous work, it focuses on the elasticity and scalability of the cloud and enhances the power of mobile cloud computing by parallelizing method execution using multiple virtual machine (VM) images.
method	We implement ThinkAir and evaluate it with a range of benchmarks starting from simple micro-benchmarks to more complex applications.
method	First, we show that the execution time and energy consumption decrease two orders of magnitude for a N-queens puzzle application and one order of magnitude for a face detection and a virus scan application.
method	We then show that a parallelizable application can invoke multiple VMs to execute in the cloud in a seamless and on-demand manner such as to achieve greater reduction on execution time and energy consumption.
method	We finally use a memory-hungry image combiner tool to demonstrate that applications can dynamically request VMs with more computational power in order to meet their computational requirements.

objective	The field of object detection has made significant advances riding on the wave of region-based ConvNets, but their training procedure still includes many heuristics and hyperparameters that are costly to tune.
objective	We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors.
objective	Our motivation is the same as it has always been - detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples.
objective	Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient.
result	OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use.
result	But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012.
result	Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset.
result	Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.

background	We describe the design and use of the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, an extensible pipeline that provides core natural language analysis.
background	This toolkit is quite widely used, both in the research NLP community and also among commercial and government users of open source NLP technology.

background	This paper describes a simple, efficient algorithm to locate all occurrences of any of a finite number of keywords in a string of text.
objective	The algorithm consists of constructing a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using the pattern matching machine to process the text string in a single pass.
method	Construction of the pattern matching machine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords.

objective	This paper discusses the need to consider possible risks to ensure business survival and business continuity before the implementation of new technologies, with specific interest to wireless networks and wireless devices.
background	Information Technology is fast becoming essential within business processes and is considered a technical issue yet neglected at board level.
background	In recent years, there has been an elevated awareness in Information Security and Corporate Governance.
background	Organisations, and their board of directors, have become increasingly aware that securing information is vital for the organisation in both financial terms and corporate identity.
background	Wireless Networks, and the use of mobile devices, are bringing the world a new means of communication and day-to-day business activities.

background	Recently, similarity queries on feature vectors have been widely used to perform content-based retrieval of images.
objective	To apply this technique to large databases, it is required to develop multidimensional index structures supporting nearest neighbor queries efficiently.
objective	The SS-tree had been proposed for this purpose and is known to outperform other index structures such as the R*-tree and the K-D-B-tree.
method	One of its most important features is that it employs bounding spheres rather than bounding rectangles for the shape of regions.
result	However, we demonstrate in this paper that bounding spheres occupy much larger volume than bounding rectangles with high-dimensional data and that this reduces search efficiency.
method	To overcome this drawback, we propose a new index structure called the SR-tree (Sphere/Rectangle-tree) which integrates bounding spheres and bounding rectangles.
result	A region of the SR-tree is specified by the intersection of a bounding sphere and a bounding rectangle.
result	Incorporating bounding rectangles permits neighborhoods to be partitioned into smaller regions than the SS-tree and improves the disjointness among regions.
result	This enhances the performance on nearest neighbor queries especially for high-dimensional and non-uniform data which can be practical in actual image/video similarity indexing.
result	We include the performance test results the verify this advantage of the SR-tree and show that the SR-tree outperforms both the SS-tree and the R*-tree.

background	Underwater range scanning techniques are starting to gain interest in underwater exploration, providing new tools to represent the seafloor.
background	These scans (often) acquired by underwater robots usually result in an unstructured point cloud, but given the common downward-looking or forward-looking configuration of these sensors with respect to the scene, the problem of recovering a piecewise linear approximation representing the scene is normally solved by approximating these 3D points using a heightmap (2.5D).
background	Nevertheless, this representation is not able to correctly represent complex structures, especially those presenting arbitrary concavities normally exhibited in underwater objects.
method	We present a method devoted to full 3D surface reconstruction that does not assume any specific sensor configuration.
method	The method presented is robust to common defects in raw scanned data such as outliers and noise often present in extreme environments such as underwater, both for sonar and optical surveys.
method	Moreover, the proposed method does not need a manual preprocessing step.
method	It is also generic as it does not need any information other than the points themselves to work.
result	This property leads to its wide application to any kind of range scanning technologies and we demonstrate its versatility by using it on synthetic data, controlled laser scans, and multibeam sonar surveys.
method	Finally, and given the unbeatable level of detail that optical methods can provide, we analyze the application of this method on optical datasets related to biology, geology

background	Invasive species are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss.
background	In the past decade, the development of environmental spectroscopy, both field spectrometers and airborne imaging spectrometers, has allowed progress in identifying individual species from remote sensing data.
objective	However, use of environmental spectroscopy for species identification needs understanding at a more fundamental level, especially the development of generalized methodologies and rules for detection and mapping, which is an area of active research today.
result	These issues will be explored using examples from a wide range of habitats and site conditions, towards the development of a robust methodology to identify native and non-native species.

background	Enforcing security in Internet of Things environments has been identified as one of the top barriers for realizing the vision of smart, energy-efficient homes and buildings.
objective	In this context, understanding the risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes, partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus requires substantial investigation.
method	A risk analysis applied on a smart home automation system developed in a research project involving leading industrial actors has been conducted.
method	Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were deemed as moderate.
method	The risks classified as high were either related to the human factor or to the software components of the system.
result	The results indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new, as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor, need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to handle.
result	A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy included in the design phase of smart homes.
result	With such a model of security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments.

background	The performance of pattern classifiers depends on the separability of the classes in the feature space - a property related to the quality of the descriptors - and the choice of informative training samples for user labeling - a procedure that usually requires active learning.
objective	This work is devoted to improve the quality of the descriptors when samples are superpixels from remote sensing images.
method	We introduce a new scheme for superpixel description based on Bag of visual Words, which includes information from adjacent superpixels, and validate it by using two remote sensing images and several region descriptors as baselines.

background	Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models.
background	In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed.
background	In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices.
result	As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL).
objective	Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and powerhungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks.
result	We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated.
result	Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.

background	We present a real-time algorithm which can recover the 3D trajectory of a monocular camera, moving rapidly through a previously unknown scene.
background	Our system, which we dub MonoSLAM, is the first successful application of the SLAM methodology from mobile robotics to the "pure vision" domain of a single uncontrolled camera, achieving real time but drift-free performance inaccessible to structure from motion approaches.
background	The core of the approach is the online creation of a sparse but persistent map of natural landmarks within a probabilistic framework.
method	Our key novel contributions include an active approach to mapping and measurement, the use of a general motion model for smooth camera movement, and solutions for monocular feature initialization and feature orientation estimation.
method	Together, these add up to an extremely efficient and robust algorithm which runs at 30 Hz with standard PC and camera hardware.
result	This work extends the range of robotic systems in which SLAM can be usefully applied, but also opens up new areas.

background	Call Centers are important channels of communication within the consumer relationship and a point of integration between suppliers and their customers.
background	Correctly sizing the capacity of a given Call Center can bring benefits not only in terms of improved customer service (efficacy), but also in terms of reduced operating costs (efficiency).
method	However, specifying the capacity of a Call Center is not a trivial task, but one that demands a significant knowledge of mathematics, in particular of analytical models.

background	We present a new dataset and model for textual entailment, derived from treating multiple-choice question-answering as an entailment problem.
result	SCITAIL is the first entailment set that is created solely from natural sentences that already exist independently “in the wild” rather than sentences authored specifically for the entailment task.
method	Different from existing entailment datasets, we create hypotheses from science questions and the corresponding answer candidates, and premises from relevant web sentences retrieved from a large corpus.
result	These sentences are often linguistically challenging.
method	This, combined with the high lexical similarity of premise and hypothesis for both entailed and non-entailed pairs, makes this new entailment task particularly difficult.
result	The resulting challenge is evidenced by state-of-the-art textual entailment systems achieving mediocre performance on SCITAIL, especially in comparison to a simple majority class baseline.
result	As a step forward, we demonstrate that one can improve accuracy on SCITAIL by 5% using a new neural model that exploits linguistic structure.

background	Chinese noun classifiers are an indispensible part of the Chinese language, but are difficult for non-native speakers to use correctly.
background	Chinese language teachers often face challenges in finding an effective way to teach classifiers, as the rules for defining which nouns can be associated with which classifiers are not straightforward.
background	Many theoretical studies have explored the nature of Chinese classifiers, but few studies take an empirical approach to the investigation of effective teaching and learning methods of classifiers.
background	Learners often find that existing dictionaries either do not have classifiers as lexical entries, or give very brief explanations that are hardly helpful.
background	This paper presents the progress of an ongoing project on the construction of an e-dictionary of Chinese classifiers.
objective	The objective of the project is to provide a platform for Chinese language learners to explore and learn classifier uses in a bottom-up fashion.
method	The current work is on the design of an e-learning tool database and its connection to the e-dictionary database.

background	We present a content-based automatic music tagging algorithm using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs).
background	We evaluate different architectures consisting of 2D convolutional layers and subsampling layers only.
background	In the experiments, we measure the AUC-ROC scores of the architectures with different complexities and input types using the MagnaTagATune dataset, where a 4-layer architecture shows state-of-the-art performance with mel-spectrogram input.
method	Furthermore, we evaluated the performances of the architectures with varying the number of layers on a larger dataset (Million Song Dataset), and found that deeper models outperformed the 4-layer architecture.
result	The experiments show that mel-spectrogram is an effective time-frequency representation for automatic tagging and that more complex models benefit from more training data.

background	This paper considers the task of matching images and sentences.
background	The challenge consists in discriminatively embedding the two modalities onto a shared visual-textual space.
background	Existing work in this field largely uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for text feature learning and employs off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction.
background	Our system, in comparison, differs in two key aspects.
method	Firstly, we build a convolutional network amenable for fine-tuning the visual and textual representations, where the entire network only contains four components, i.e., convolution layer, pooling layer, rectified linear unit function (ReLU), and batch normalisation.
method	Endto-end learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilise the supervisions.
method	Secondly, we propose instance loss according to viewing each multimodal data pair as a class.
method	This works with a large margin objective to learn the inter-modal correspondence between images and their textual descriptions.
result	Experiments on two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO) demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
result	Moreover, in language person retrieval, we improve the state of the art by a large margin.

background	ROC analysis is increasingly being recognised as an important tool for evaluation and comparison of classifiers when the operating characteristics (i.e. class distribution and cost parameters) are not known at training time.
background	Usually, each classifier is characterised by its estimated true and false positive rates and is represented by a single point in the ROC diagram.
objective	In this paper, we show how a single decision tree can represent a set of classifiers by choosing different labellings of its leaves, or equivalently, an ordering on the leaves.
objective	In this setting, rather than estimating the accuracy of a single tree, it makes more sense to use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a quality metric.
objective	We also propose a novel splitting criterion which chooses the split with the highest local AUC.
background	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first probabilistic splitting criterion that is not based on weighted average impurity.
result	We present experiments suggesting that the AUC splitting criterion leads to trees with equal or better AUC value, without sacrificing accuracy if a single labelling is chosen.

background	As the models and the datasets to train deep learning (DL) models scale, system architects are faced with new challenges, one of which is the memory capacity bottleneck, where the limited physical memory inside the accelerator device constrains the algorithm that can be studied.
objective	We propose a memory-centric deep learning system that can transparently expand the memory capacity accessible to the accelerators while also providing fast inter-device communication for parallel training.
objective	Our proposal aggregates a pool of memory modules locally within the device-side interconnect, which are decoupled from the host interface and function as a vehicle for transparent memory capacity expansion.
result	Compared to conventional systems, our proposal achieves an average <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$2.1\times$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="rhu-ieq1-2823302.gif"/> </alternatives></inline-formula> speedup on eight DL applications and increases the system-wide memory capacity to tens of TBs.

background	In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates.
background	While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace.
background	This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data.
background	The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process.

background	A growing number of information technology systems and services are being developed to change users’ attitudes or behavior or both.
background	Despite the fact that attitudinal theories from social psychology have been quite extensively applied to the study of user intentions and behavior, these theories have been developed for predicting user acceptance of the information technology rather than for providing systematic analysis and design methods for developing persuasive software solutions.

background	This paper presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors.
background	Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer.
objective	The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation.
objective	A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined.
method	The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions.
method	The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame.
background	The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter.
result	As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time.
result	Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory.
result	Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels.

background	Inventory systems with uncertainty go hand in hand with the determination of a safety stock level.
background	The decision on the safety stock level is based on a performance measure, for example the expected shortage per replenishment period or the probability of a stock-out per replenishment period.
method	The performance measure assumes complete knowledge of the probability distribution during lead time, which might not be available.
objective	In case of incomplete information regarding the lead-time distribution of demand, no single figure for the safety stock can de determined in order to satisfy a performance measure.
objective	However, an optimisation model may be formulated in order to determine a safety stock level which guarantees the performance measure under the worst case of lead-time demand, of which the distribution is known in an incomplete way.
result	It is shown that this optimisation problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem.

background	User-generated reviews on the Web contain sentiments about detailed aspects of products and services.
background	However, most of the reviews are plain text and thus require much effort to obtain information about relevant details.
method	In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically discovering what aspects are evaluated in reviews and how sentiments for different aspects are expressed.
method	We first propose Sentence-LDA (SLDA), a probabilistic generative model that assumes all words in a single sentence are generated from one aspect.
method	We then extend SLDA to Aspect and Sentiment Unification Model (ASUM), which incorporates aspect and sentiment together to model sentiments toward different aspects.
method	ASUM discovers pairs of {aspect, sentiment} which we call senti-aspects.
method	We applied SLDA and ASUM to reviews of electronic devices and restaurants.
result	The results show that the aspects discovered by SLDA match evaluative details of the reviews, and the senti-aspects found by ASUM capture important aspects that are closely coupled with a sentiment.
result	The results of sentiment classification show that ASUM outperforms other generative models and comes close to supervised classification methods.
result	One important advantage of ASUM is that it does not require any sentiment labels of the reviews, which are often expensive to obtain.

background	The paper presents the results of a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) development for the diesel engine air path.
objective	The objective is to regulate the intake manifold pressure (MAP) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate to the specified set-points by coordinated control of the variable geometry turbine (VGT), EGR valve, and EGR throttle.
method	The approach uses tube-MPC to robustly enforce state constraints in the presence of set-bounded engine speed and fueling disturbances.
method	Furthermore, a rate-based formulation along with various approximations is applied to reduce the conservativeness and computational complexity of tube-MPC.
result	The ability of the controller to handle input and output constraints is demonstrated in both nonlinear model simulations and experimental results.

background	Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data.
background	Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences.
background	In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences.
background	Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities.
background	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes.
background	Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window.
objective	Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them.
background	In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition.
background	In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models.

background	The rapid adoption of heterogeneous computing has driven the integration of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) into cloud datacenters and flexible System-on-Chips (SoCs).
objective	This paper shows that the integrated FPGA introduces a new security vulnerability by enabling software-based power side-channel attacks without physical proximity to a target system.
method	We first demonstrate that an on-chip power monitor can be built on a modern FPGA using ring oscillators (ROs), and characterize its ability to observe the power consumption of other modules on the FPGA or the SoC. Then, we show that the RO-based FPGA power monitor can be used for a successful power analysis attack on an RSA cryptomodule on the same FPGA.
result	Additionally, we show that the FPGA-based power monitor can observe the power consumption of a CPU on the same SoC, and demonstrate that the FPGA-to-CPU power side-channel attack can break timing-channel protection for a RSA program running on a CPU.
result	This work introduces and demonstrates remote power side-channel attacks using an FPGA, showing that the common assumption that power side-channel attacks require specialized equipment and physical access to the victim hardware is not true for systems with an integrated FPGA.

background	In recent decades, the ad hoc network for vehicles has been a core network technology to provide comfort and security to drivers in vehicle environments.
background	However, emerging applications and services require major changes in underlying network models and computing that require new road network planning.

background	Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for unsupervised dimension reduction.
background	K-means clustering is a commonly used data clustering for performing unsupervised learning tasks.
method	Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering.
method	New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix.
method	These results indicate that unsupervised dimension reduction is closely related to unsupervised learning.
result	Several implications are discussed.
result	On dimension reduction, the result provides new insights to the observed effectiveness of PCA-based data reductions, beyond the conventional noise-reduction explanation that PCA, via singular value decomposition, provides the best low-dimensional linear approximation of the data.
result	On learning, the result suggests effective techniques for K-means data clustering.
result	DNA gene expression and Internet newsgroups are analyzed to illustrate our results.

objective	A recommender system aims to recommend items that a user is interested in among many items.
background	The need for the recommender system has been expanded by the information explosion.
method	Various approaches have been suggested for providing meaningful recommendations to users.
method	One of the proposed approaches is to consider a recommender system as aMarkov decision process (MDP) problem and try to solve it using reinforcement learning (RL).
method	However, existing RL-based methods have an obvious drawback.
result	To solve an MDP in a recommender system, they encountered a problem with the large number of discrete actions that bring RL to a larger class of problems.
method	In this paper, we propose a novel RL-based recommender system.
method	We formulate a recommender system as a gridworld game by using a biclustering technique that can reduce the state and action space significantly.
method	Using biclustering not only reduces space but also improves the recommendation quality effectively handling the cold-start problem.
result	In addition, our approach can provide users with some explanation why the system recommends certain items.

background	In this chapter methods of handling missing attribute values in data mining are described.
background	These methods are categorized into sequential and parallel.
method	In sequential methods, missing attribute values are replaced by known values first, as a preprocessing, then the knowledge is acquired for a data set with all known attribute values.
method	In parallel methods, there is no preprocessing, i.e., knowledge is acquired directly from the original data sets.
method	In this chapter the main emphasis is put on rule induction.
method	Methods of handling attribute values for decision tree generation are only briefly summarized.

background	We study the problem of object recognition for categories for which we have no training examples, a task also called zero--data or zero-shot learning.
background	This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them.
objective	To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape.
method	Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task.
method	Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase.
result	In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes.
result	Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes.

background	We present an unsupervised representation learning approach that compactly encodes the motion dependencies in videos.
background	Given a pair of images from a video clip, our framework learns to predict the long-term 3D motions.
background	To reduce the complexity of the learning framework, we propose to describe the motion as a sequence of atomic 3D flows computed with RGB-D modality.
method	We use a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder framework to predict these sequences of flows.
method	We argue that in order for the decoder to reconstruct these sequences, the encoder must learn a robust video representation that captures long-term motion dependencies and spatial-temporal relations.
method	We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned temporal representations on activity classification across multiple modalities and datasets such as NTU RGB+D and MSR Daily Activity 3D.
method	Our framework is generic to any input modality, i.e., RGB, depth, and RGB-D videos.

background	We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility maximization in multichannel wireless networks.
background	The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels, and the users access the spectrum using a random access protocol.
background	In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain attempt probability.
background	After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal).
objective	The objective is to find a multi-user strategy that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users.
objective	Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states.
method	To tackle this problem, we develop a distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning.
method	Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function.
result	Experimental results have demonstrated that users are capable to learn good policies that achieve strong performance in this challenging partially observable setting only from their ACK signals, without online coordination, message exchanges between users, or carrier sensing.

background	We present a new method to visualize from an ensemble of flow fields the statistical properties of streamlines passing through a selected location.
method	We use principal component analysis to transform the set of streamlines into a low-dimensional Euclidean space.
method	In this space the streamlines are clustered into major trends, and each cluster is in turn approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
background	This yields a probabilistic mixture model for the streamline distribution, from which confidence regions can be derived in which the streamlines are most likely to reside.
method	This is achieved by transforming the Gaussian random distributions from the low-dimensional Euclidean space into a streamline distribution that follows the statistical model, and by visualizing confidence regions in this distribution via iso-contours.
method	We further make use of the principal component representation to introduce a new concept of streamline-median, based on existing median concepts in multidimensional Euclidean spaces.
result	We demonstrate the potential of our method in a number of real-world examples, and we compare our results to alternative clustering approaches for particle trajectories as well as curve boxplots.

background	The ever-increasing size of modern data sets combined with the difficulty of obtaining label information has made semi-supervised learning one of the problems of significant practical importance in modern data analysis.
background	We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones.
background	Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable.
method	We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.

background	'No-shows' or missed appointments result in under-utilized clinic capacity.
objective	We develop a logistic regression model using electronic medical records to estimate patients' no-show probabilities and illustrate the use of the estimates in creating clinic schedules that maximize clinic capacity utilization while maintaining small patient waiting times and clinic overtime costs.
method	This study used information on scheduled outpatient appointments collected over a three-year period at a Veterans Affairs medical center.
method	The call-in process for 400 clinic days was simulated and for each day two schedules were created: the traditional method that assigned one patient per appointment slot, and the proposed method that scheduled patients according to their no-show probability to balance patient waiting, overtime and revenue.
method	Combining patient no-show models with advanced scheduling methods would allow more patients to be seen a day while improving clinic efficiency.
result	Clinics should consider the benefits of implementing scheduling software that includes these methods relative to the cost of no-shows.

background	We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification.
background	Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology.
objective	Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set.
method	This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call cardinality (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width.
method	On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy.
method	Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity.
result	Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place.
result	We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart.
result	The code and models are publicly available online.

background	The proliferation of cyber-physical systems introduces the fourth stage of industrialization, commonly known as Industry 4.0.
background	The vertical integration of various components inside a factory to implement a flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing system, i.e., smart factory, is one of the key features of Industry 4.0.
background	In this paper, we present a smart factory framework that incorporates industrial network, cloud, and supervisory control terminals with smart shop-floor objects such as machines, conveyers, and products.
method	Then, we provide a classification of the smart objects into various types of agents and define a coordinator in the cloud.
method	The autonomous decision and distributed cooperation between agents lead to high flexibility.
method	Moreover, this kind of self-organized system leverages the feedback and coordination by the central coordinator in order to achieve high efficiency.
method	Thus, the smart factory is characterized by a self-organized multi-agent system assisted with big data based feedback and coordination.
method	Based on this model, we propose an intelligent negotiation mechanism for agents to cooperate with each other.
method	Furthermore, the study illustrates that complementary strategies can be designed to prevent deadlocks by improving the agents’ decision making and the coordinator’s behavior.
result	The simulation results assess the effectiveness of the proposed negotiation mechanism and deadlock prevention strategies.

method	Our models rely on two sources of information about words: character-based word representations learned from the supervised corpus and unsupervised word representations learned from unannotated corpora.
objective	Our models obtain state-of-the-art performance in NER in four languages without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers.

background	An understanding of quality attributes is relevant for the software organization to deliver high software reliability.
background	An empirical assessment of metrics to predict the quality attributes is essential in order to gain insight about the quality of software in the early phases of software development and to ensure corrective actions.
objective	In this paper, we predict a model to estimate fault proneness using Object Oriented CK metrics and QMOOD metrics.

method	Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy.
method	Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs.
result	In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92% of the time.
result	By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.

background	Localization is one important part of Internet of Things(IoT) where the Location of Everything (LoE) system plays a important role to improve most services in IoT area.
background	On the other hand, data mining techniques are essential analyses when we have big data from IoT platforms.
background	Indeed, integration of location-based methods and data mining analysis process can make a smart system service for IoT scenarios and applications.
method	For this purpose, we design a smart shopping platform including four components, location of everything component, data collection component, data filtering/analysing component and data mining component.
method	Then a novel accurate localization scheme named “location orbital” is developed that estimates the current location of mobile objects (users or everything) based on both current and the previous locations.

method	This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on graytone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in categoryidentification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories.
objective	We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule).
objective	In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set.
background	Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.
result	These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.

background	We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains.
method	We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows.
method	We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multiagent coordination.
method	Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies.
method	We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.

background	Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor.
method	In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving.
objective	We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving.
method	Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously.
method	Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction.
method	To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments.
result	We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset.
result	Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

background	As business competition becomes global, international information systems (IIS) management presents a signi®cant challenge to multinational corporations and their af®liates.
background	However, very few empirical studies have been conducted to investigate the management of IIS and the issues that confront the IS executives of such corporations.
objective	In this study, we perform a three-round Delphi study to identify, rank and evaluate the twenty most signi®cant IIS issues of af®liates.
method	The ratings of these issues suggest that technology infrastructure concerns, rather than planning and management concerns, have a larger impact on the IS operations of foreign af®liates.
method	This study also reports on statistical analyses to differentiate the impact of different industries, respondents, IS structures and international involvement of af®liates on IIS issues ratings.
result	The results indicate that respondents of IS and non-IS executives and af®liates of different international involvement levels have different views on the ratings of IIS issues.
result	Our study also con®rms that IIS issues can signi®cantly impact the strategic, tactical and operational IS decisions of af®liates.
result	These ®ndings allow some important implications to be drawn for both practitioners and researchers dealing with IIS issues.

background	IT architecture is often assumed to follow business strategy, to align IT with the business’s strategic objectives.
background	Increasingly, though, many business strategies depend on specific underlying IT capabilities.
background	To develop a synergy between business strategy and IT architecture, firms must develop organizational competencies in IT architecture.
objective	My research has identified four IT architectural stages, each with its own requisite competencies.
method	The “application silo architecture stage” consists of IT architectures of individual applications.
method	The “standardized technology architecture stage” has an enterprise-wide IT architecture that provides efficiencies through technology standardization.
result	The “rationalized data architecture stage” extends the enterprise-wide IT standards to data and processes.
result	And the “modular architecture stage” builds onto enterprise-wide global standards with loosely coupled IT components to preserve the global standards while enabling local differences.

background	With the advances in the development of mobile payments, a huge amount of payment data are collected by banks.
background	User payment data offer a good dataset to depict customer behavior patterns.
background	A comprehensive understanding of customers' purchase behavior is crucial to developing good marketing strategies, which may trigger much greater purchase amounts.
method	For example, by exploring customer behavior patterns, given a target store, a set of potential customers is able to be identified.
background	In other words, personalized campaigns at the right time and in the right place can be treated as the last stage of consumption.
objective	Here we propose a probability graphical model that exploits the payment data to discover customer purchase behavior in the spatial, temporal, payment amount and product category aspects, named STPC-PGM.
result	As a result, the mobility behavior of an individual user could be predicted with a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for all aspects of each customer's relationship with the payment platform.
method	To achieve real time advertising, we then develop an online framework that efficiently computes the prediction results.
result	Our experiment results show that STPC-PGM is effective in discovering customers' profiling features, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in purchase behavior prediction.
result	In addition, the prediction results are being deployed in the marketing of real-world credit card users, and have presented a significant growth in the advertising conversion rate.

background	Hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and a set of classified examples to develop a method for accurately classifying examples not seen during training.
background	The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to offset information missing from the other source.
background	By so doing, a hybrid learning system should learn more effectively than systems that use only one of the information sources.
background	KBANN(Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system built on top of connectionist learning techniques.
method	It maps problem-specific “domain theories”, represented in propositional logic, into neural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge using backpropagation.
method	KBANN is evaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecular biology.
result	Among other results, these tests show that the networks created by KBANN generalize better than a wide variety of learning systems, as well as several techniques proposed by biologists.

background	Gamification evolved to one of the most important trends in technology and therefore gains more and more practical and scientific notice.
background	Yet academia lacks a comprehensive overview of research, even though a review of prior, relevant literature is essential for advancing knowledge in a field.
objective	Therefore a novel classification framework for Gamification in Information Systems with the intention to provide a structured, summarized as well as organized overview was constructed to close this gap of research.
method	A literature review on Gamification in quality outlets combined with a Grounded Theory approach served as a starting point.
method	As a result this paper provides a foundation for current and future research to advance the knowledge on Gamification.
result	Moreover it offers a structure for Gamification research which was not available previously.
result	Findings from the literature review were mapped to the classification framework and analyzed.
result	Derived from the classification framework and its outcome future research outlets were identified.

objective	We present a method that learns word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification in this paper.
background	Most existing algorithms for learning continuous word representations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment of text.
background	This is problematic for sentiment analysis as they usually map words with similar syntactic context but opposite sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors.
method	We address this issue by learning sentimentspecific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the continuous representation of words.
method	Specifically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions.
method	To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons.
result	Experiments on applying SSWE to a benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the performance is further improved by concatenating SSWE with existing feature set.

background	We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning.
objective	The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples.
method	In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task.
method	In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.
result	We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two fewshot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.

background	There is an increased awareness of the roles that e nterprise architecture (EA) and enterprise systems (ES) play in today ’s organizations.
background	EA and ES usage maturity models are used to assess how well c ompanies are capable of deploying these two concepts while striving to achi eve strategic corporate goals.
background	The existence of various architecture and ES usage models raises questions about how they both refer to each other, e.g. if a higher level of architecture maturity implies a higher ES usage level.
objective	This paper compares these two types of models by using literature survey results and case-study experiences.
result	We conclude that (i) EA and ES usage maturity model s agree on a number of critical success factors and (ii) in a company with a mature architecture function, one is likely to observe, at the early stages of ES initiatives, certain practices associated with a higher level of ES usage ma turity.

background	From scientific research to commercial applications, eye tracking is an important tool across many domains.
background	Despite its range of applications, eye tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology.
background	We believe that we can put the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the need for additional sensors or devices.
method	We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2:5M frames.
method	Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device.
method	Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively.
method	With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm.
result	Further, we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

background	A novel swarm intelligence optimization technique is proposed called dragonfly algorithm (DA).
background	The main inspiration of the DA algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature.
background	Two essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically.

objective	We propose a new approach for general object tracking with fully convolutional neural network.
method	Instead of treating convolutional neural network (CNN) as a black-box feature extractor, we conduct in-depth study on the properties of CNN features offline pre-trained on massive image data and classification task on ImageNet.
result	The discoveries motivate the design of our tracking system.
result	It is found that convolutional layers in different levels characterize the target from different perspectives.
result	A top layer encodes more semantic features and serves as a category detector, while a lower layer carries more discriminative information and can better separate the target from distracters with similar appearance.
result	Both layers are jointly used with a switch mechanism during tracking.
background	It is also found that for a tracking target, only a subset of neurons are relevant.
method	A feature map selection method is developed to remove noisy and irrelevant feature maps, which can reduce computation redundancy and improve tracking accuracy.

background	The representation of a knowledge graph (KG) in a latent space recently has attracted more and more attention.
background	To this end, some proposed models (e.g., TransE) embed entities and relations of a KG into a "point" vector space by optimizing a global loss function which ensures the scores of positive triplets are higher than negative ones.
background	We notice that these models always regard all entities and relations in a same manner and ignore their (un)certainties.
method	In fact, different entities and relations may contain different certainties, which makes identical certainty insufficient for modeling.
method	Therefore, this paper switches to density-based embedding and propose KG2E for explicitly modeling the certainty of entities and relations, which learn the representations of KGs in the space of multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
result	Each entity/relation is represented by a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes its position and the covariance (currently with diagonal covariance) can properly represent its certainty.
method	In addition, compared with the symmetric measures used in point-based methods, we employ the KL-divergence for scoring triplets, which is a natural asymmetry function for effectively modeling multiple types of relations.
result	We have conducted extensive experiments on link prediction and triplet classification with multiple benchmark datasets (WordNet and Freebase).
result	Our experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively model the (un)certainties of entities and relations in a KG, and it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (including TransH and TransR).

objective	To this end, we investigate various ways to trade accuracy for speed and memory usage in modern convolutional object detection systems.
method	A number of successful systems have been proposed in recent years, but apples-toapples comparisons are difficult due to different base feature extractors (e.g., VGG, Residual Networks), different default image resolutions, as well as different hardware and software platforms.
method	We present a unified implementation of the Faster R-CNN [30], R-FCN [6] and SSD [25] systems, which we view as meta-architectures and trace out the speed/accuracy trade-off curve created by using alternative feature extractors and varying other critical parameters such as image size within each of these meta-architectures.
method	On one extreme end of this spectrum where speed and memory are critical, we present a detector that achieves real time speeds and can be deployed on a mobile device.

method	We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes.
method	Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas.
result	We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.

background	Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care.
background	Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured.
method	Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them.
result	There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge.
method	The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data.
method	In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain.
method	Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health.
result	However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists.

method	We compare WHOPR’s compile time, memory usage, and code quality to the results of the classical file-byfile optimization model, focusing on its effects on GCC itself and the Firefox web browser.

background	In this study we investigate how social media shape the networked public sphere and facilitate communication between communities with different political orientations.
result	We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections.
method	Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between leftand right-leaning users.
method	Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets.
background	To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users.
result	We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis.

objective	This paper describes the configuration of a floor-tile installation robot for commercial buildings.
objective	The research is motivated by the need to reduce the installation time and cost while guaranteeing consistent quality.
objective	In order to compete with human installation, a time of 24 seconds per installed tile has to be matched.

background	The main generalization techniques employed by memory-based learning systems are the nearest-neighbor search, space decomposition techniques, and clustering.
background	Research on memory-based learning is still in its early stage.
background	In particular, there are very few rigorous theoretical results regarding memory requirement, sample size, expected performance, and computational complexity.
objective	In this paper, we propose a model for memory-based learning and use it to analyze several methods— ε-covering, hashing, clustering, tree-structured clustering, and receptive-fields—for learning smooth functions.
method	The sample size and system complexity are derived for each method.
method	Our model is built upon the generalized PAC learning model of Haussler
result	(Haussler, 1989) and is closely related to the method of vector quantization in data compression.
result	Our main result is that we can build memory-based learning systems using new clustering algorithms (Lin & Vitter, 1992a) to PAC-learn in polynomial time using only polynomial storage in typical situations.

background	The use of the Internet by older adults is growing at a substantial rate.
background	They are becoming an increasingly important potential market for electronic commerce.
background	However, previous researchers and practitioners have focused mainly on the youth market and paid less attention to issues related to the online behaviors of older consumers.
result	To bridge the gap, the purpose of this study is to increase a better understanding of the drivers and barriers affecting older consumers’ intention to shop online.
objective	To this end, this study is developed by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and innovation resistance theory.
result	By comparing younger consumers with their older counterparts, in terms of gender the findings indicate that the major factors driving older adults toward online shopping are performance expectation and social influence which is the same with younger.
result	On the other hand, the major barriers include value, risk, and tradition which is different from younger.
result	Consequently, it is notable that older adults show no gender differences in regards to the drivers and barriers.

background	This study captures the state of current satellite transponder technology, specifically, solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) and traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), and describes expected future advances, including GaN SSPAs.
background	The findings of five previous SSPA and TWTA studies, including the 1991 European Space and Technology Center study, the 1993 National Aeronautics and Space Administration study, and three Boeing studies conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2013, are tabulated and summarized.
background	The results of these studies are then compared with new analyses of two validated sources of amplifier data: a commercially licensed database, Seradata’s Spacetrak, and a publicly available database, Gunter’s Space Page.
result	The new analyses consider a total of 18,902 amplifiers (6428 TWTAs, 2158 SSPAs, and 10,316 unspecified amplifiers) onboard 565 communications satellites launched from 1982 to 2016.
result	This new study contains the largest number of satellites and amplifiers to date and compares output power, redundancy, and bandwidth capabilities.
result	We find an increase in output power from the 1993 study of >200% for Ku-band TWTAs and C-band SSPAs, and >1000% increase for C-band TWTAs.
result	The ratio of operational to redundant amplifiers is 10 times higher for TWTAs than SSPAs, and the majority of amplifiers over the past 30 years operate with bandwidth less than 100MHz.
result	A second analysis is conducted using failure records and telemetry of 16 geostationary satellites equipped with 659 amplifiers: 535 SSPAs and 124 TWTAs.
result	We find that <2% of TWTAs and 5% of SSPAs experience anomalies.
objective	Overall, this research was performed to update and clarify how the power and bandwidth needs and redundancy trends of the SatCom community have evolved over the past 30 years.

objective	Knowledge graph completion aims to perform link prediction between entities.
background	In this paper, we consider the approach of knowledge graph embeddings.
background	Recently, models such as TransE and TransH build entity and relation embeddings by regarding a relation as translation from head entity to tail entity.
background	We note that these models simply put both entities and relations within the same semantic space.
background	In fact, an entity may have multiple aspects and various relations may focus on different aspects of entities, which makes a common space insufficient for modeling.
method	In this paper, we propose TransR to build entity and relation embeddings in separate entity space and relation spaces.
method	Afterwards, we learn embeddings by first projecting entities from entity space to corresponding relation space and then building translations between projected entities.
result	In experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including link prediction, triple classification and relational fact extraction.
result	Experimental results show significant and consistent improvements compared to stateof-the-art baselines including TransE and TransH. The source code of this paper can be obtained from https: //github.com/mrlyk423/relation extraction.

background	Several real world prediction problems involve forecasting rare values of a target variable.
background	When this variable is nominal we have a problem of class imbalance that was already studied thoroughly within machine learning.
background	For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem.
result	Still, important application areas involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.
other	This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks.
other	Namely, we propose to address such tasks by sampling approaches.
result	These approaches change the distribution of the given training data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones.
result	We present a modification of the well-known Smote algorithm that allows its use on these regression tasks.
result	In an extensive set of experiments we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks.
result	The proposed SmoteR method can be used with any existing regression algorithm turning it into a general tool for addressing problems of forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable.

background	E-mail address: rebecca.brand@villanova.edu (R.J. Attractive people are considered by others to have many positive qualities and in the case of social skills and intelligence, these attributions are often true.
background	In internet dating, individuals with attractive profile photos are viewed more favorably overall, but no research has yet established whether they indeed have more positive qualities.
method	We addressed this issue by having 50 women independently rate 100 photos and free-written texts taken from males’ profiles on a popular dating website.
method	Photos rated as physically attractive had profile texts that were rated as more attractive, even though photos and texts were rated by different judges.
method	Perceived confidence seemed to play a mediating role, suggesting that attractive men write appealing texts because they are aware of their high mate value.
other	Thus, contrary to popular belief, the internet does not seem to ‘‘level the playing field.

background	Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where a number of evaluators are presented with an interface design and asked to comment on it.
background	Four experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51% of the usability problems in the interfaces they evaluated.
result	On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.

background	Advanced mobile technology continues to shape professional environments.
background	Smart cell phones, pocket computers and laptop computers reduce the need of users to remain close to a wired information system infrastructure and allow for task performance in many different contexts.
objective	Among the consequences are changes in technology requirements, such as the need to limit weight and size of the devices.
method	In the current paper, we focus on the factors that users find important in mobile devices.
method	Based on a content analysis of online user reviews that was followed by structural equation modeling, we found four factors to be significantly related with overall user evaluation, namely functionality, portability, performance, and usability.
method	Besides the practical relevance for technology developers and managers, our research results contribute to the discussion about the extent to which previously established theories of technology adoption and use are applicable to mobile technology.
result	We also discuss the methodological suitability of online user reviews for the assessment of user requirements, and the complementarity of automated and non-automated forms of content analysis.

background	Big Data governance requires a data governance that can satisfy the needs for corporate governance, IT governance, and ITA/EA.
background	While the existing data governance focuses on the processing of structured data, Big Data governance needs to be established in consideration of a broad sense of Big Data services including unstructured data.
objective	To achieve the goals of Big Data, strategies need to be established together with goals that are aligned with the vision and objective of an organization.
method	In addition to the preparation of the IT infrastructure, a proper preparation of the components is required to effectively implement the strategy for Big Data services.
method	We propose the Big Data Governance Framework in this paper.
method	The Big Data governance framework presents criteria different from existing criteria at the data quality level.
method	It focuses on timely, reliable, meaningful, and sufficient data services, focusing on what data attributes should be achieved based on the data attributes of Big Data services.
method	In addition to the quality level of Big Data, the personal information protection strategy and the data disclosure/accountability strategy are also needed to achieve goals and to prevent problems.
method	This paper performed case analysis based on the Big Data Governance Framework with the National Pension Service of South Korea.

background	3D face reconstruction is a fundamental Computer Vision problem of extraordinary difficulty.
background	Current systems often assume the availability of multiple facial images (sometimes from the same subject) as input, and must address a number of methodological challenges such as establishing dense correspondences across large facial poses, expressions, and non-uniform illumination.
background	In general these methods require complex and inefficient pipelines for model building and fitting.
objective	In this work, we propose to address many of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans.
objective	Our CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accurate alignment nor establishes dense correspondence between images, works for arbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the whole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face) bypassing the construction (during training) and fitting (during testing) of a 3D Morphable Model.
result	We achieve this via a simple CNN architecture that performs direct regression of a volumetric representation of the 3D facial geometry from a single 2D image.
result	We also demonstrate how the related task of facial landmark localization can be incorporated into the proposed framework and help improve reconstruction quality, especially for the cases of large poses and facial expressions.

background	E-government research has become a recognized research domain and many policies and strategies are formulated for e-government implementations.
background	Most of these target the next few years and limited attention has been giving to the long term.
background	The eGovRTD2020, a European Commission co-funded project, investigated the future research on e-government driven by changing circumstances and the evolution of technology.
objective	This project consists of an analysis of the state of play, a scenario-building, a gap analysis and a roadmapping activity.
method	In this paper the roadmapping methodology fitting the unique characteristics of the e-government field is presented and the results are briefly discussed.
method	The use of this methodology has resulted in the identification of a large number of e-government research themes.
method	It was found that a roadmapping methodology should match the unique characteristics of e-government.
result	The research shows the need of multidisciplinary research.

background	With the spread of data mining technologies and the accumulation of social data, such technologies and data are being used for determinations that seriously affect individuals’ lives.
background	For example, credit scoring is frequently determined based on the records of past credit data together with statistical prediction techniques.
background	Needless to say, such determinations must be nondiscriminatory and fair in sensitive features, such as race, gender, religion, and so on.
objective	Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination.
method	They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information.
result	In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning.
method	We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models.
method	We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.

result	The data visualizations represent an identical hierarchical dataset, which has been normalized in terms of color, typography and layout balance.
method	This study measured parameters such as speed of completion, accuracy rate, task abandonment and latency of erroneous response.
result	Our findings demonstrate a correlation between latency in task abandonment and erroneous response time in relation to visualization's perceived aesthetic.
result	These results support the need for an increased recognition for aesthetic in the typical evaluation process of data visualization techniques.

method	The proposed Behavior-CNN is trained with real-scene crowd data and then thoroughly investigated from multiple aspects, including the location map and location awareness property, semantic meanings of learned filters, and the influence of receptive fields on behavior modeling.
result	Multiple applications, including walking path prediction, destination prediction, and tracking, demonstrate the effectiveness of Behavior-CNN on pedestrian behavior modeling.

background	A different paradigm is needed for real-time command and control (C&C) problems.
background	Past approaches, using multiprocessors (MP), for real-time computing have had great difficulty in meeting real problem requirements.
background	We review some reasons why C&C problems that require a solution on a MP architecture may be intractable, and then show an architecture where these reasons for intractability are nonexistent.
method	We describe a polynomial time solution to the air traffic control (ATC) problem, which is a typical C&C problem.
method	This solution uses a static, non-preemptive table driven schedule using a SIMD architecture called an associative processor (AP).
result	The AP is an ideal processor for set and database operations since its single thread instruction stream can operate on an entire set of data with each instruction.
result	The AP eliminates multi-thread instructions, which account for much of the MP intractability mentioned above.

background	This paper introduces a novel algorithm that increases the efficiency of the current cloud-based smart-parking system and develops a network architecture based on the Internet-of-Things technology.
background	This paper proposed a system that helps users automatically find a free parking space at the least cost based on new performance metrics to calculate the user parking cost by considering the distance and the total number of free places in each car park.
background	This cost will be used to offer a solution of finding an available parking space upon a request by the user and a solution of suggesting a new car park if the current car park is full.
objective	The simulation results show that the algorithm helps improve the probability of successful parking and minimizes the user waiting time.
result	We also successfully implemented the proposed system in the real world.

method	To address these issues, we present a definition model to help define both cyber warfare and cyber war.
method	The paper then identifies nine research challenges in cyber warfare and analyses contemporary work carried out in each.

background	Industry 4.0 stands for the 4 Industrial revolution and the new paradigm of autonomous and decentralized control in production.
background	Products and production systems are enhanced to Cyber Physical Systems which have the capability to communicate with each other, to build ad-hoc networks and for self-control and self-optimization.
background	From the IT-perspective this involves a new level of networking, data integration and data processing in production.
background	Established technologies like Internet of Things, Cloud or Big Data are propagated solution-components of Industry 4.0.
background	So far, there is no founded elaboration of IT-requirements and no differentiated discussion on how solution-components fulfil these requirements.

objective	Objective of analysis is a structured compilation of requirements regarding data processing.
method	The resulting category scheme enables further development of solution-components in the application domain of Industry 4.0.

background	Improvement of traffic safety by cooperative vehicular applications is one of the most promising benefits of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
background	However, to properly develop such applications, the influence of different driving parameters on the event of vehicle collision must be assessed at an early design stage.
objective	In this paper, we derive a stochastic model for the number of accidents in a platoon of vehicles equipped with a warning collision notification system, which is able to inform all the vehicles about an emergency event.
method	In fact, the assumption of communications being used is key to simplify the derivation of a stochastic model.
method	The model enables the computation of the average number of collisions that occur in the platoon, the probabilities of the different ways in which the collisions may take place, as well as other statistics of interest.
method	Although an exponential distribution has been used for the traffic density, it is also valid for different probability distributions for traffic densities, as well as for other significant parameters of the model.
method	Moreover, the actual communication system employed is independent of the model since it is abstracted by a message delay variable, which allows it to be used to evaluate different communication technologies.
result	We validate the proposed model with Monte Carlo simulations.
result	With this model, one can quickly evaluate numerically the influence of different model parameters (vehicle density, velocities, decelerations, and delays) on the collision process and draw conclusions that shed relevant guidelines for the design of vehicular communication systems, as well as chain collision avoidance applications.
result	Illustrative examples of application are provided, although a systematic characterization and evaluation of different scenarios is left as future work.

background	‘‘If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
result	’’ and, paraphrasing the proverbial philosophy question, if a company has a strong CSR commitment but nobody recognizes it, does it produce any benefits?
background	Business returns from corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, such as customers loyalty and company reputation, depend heavily on how stakeholders perceive the company social behavior, making the measure of stakeholder perception a key issue in the process of CSR assessment.
objective	In this paper the analysis of CSR activities, as perceived by stakeholders, is realized utilizing global reporting initiative (GRI) indicators structured under balanced scorecard (BSC) perspectives and sustainability dimensions.
method	We utilize a multi-criteria approach combined with fuzzy linguistic variables, in the variation of the 2-tuple, creating a hierarchy of CSR components with the purpose of integrating financial and non-financial sustainability dimensions and strategic perspectives.
result	The hierarchy provides a multidimensional model that allows to evaluate the multifaceted social behavior of a company: the same company can be perceived simultaneously as responsible or irresponsible depending on the considered dimension and perspective.

background	A new musical instrument classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented in this paper.
method	Unlike the traditional methods, we investigated a scheme for classifying musical instruments using the learned features from CNNs.
method	To create the learned features from CNNs, we not only used a conventional spectrogram image, but also proposed multiresolution recurrence plots (MRPs) that contain the phase information of a raw input signal.
method	Consequently, we fed the characteristic timbre of the particular instrument into a neural network, which cannot be extracted using a phase-blinded representations such as a spectrogram.
result	By combining our proposed MRPs and spectrogram images with a multi-column network, the performance of our proposed classifier system improves over a system that uses only a spectrogram.
result	Furthermore, the proposed classifier also outperforms the baseline result from traditional handcrafted features and classifiers.

background	We present an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving optimization problems with an ℓ1 regularized least-squares cost function subject to recursive equality constraints.
method	The considered optimization problem has applications in control, for example in ℓ1 regularized MPC.
method	The ADMM algorithm is easy to implement, converges fast to a solution of moderate accuracy, and enables separation of the optimization problem into sub-problems that may be solved in parallel.
method	We show that the most costly step of the proposed ADMM algorithm is equivalent to solving an LQ regulator problem with an extra linear term in the cost function, a problem that can be solved efficiently using a Riccati recursion.
method	We apply the ADMM algorithm to an example of ℓ1 regularized MPC.
result	The numerical examples confirm fast convergence to sufficient accuracy and a linear complexity in the MPC prediction horizon.

background	Information technology should have much to offer linguistics, not only through the opportunities offered by large-scale data analysis and the stimulus to develop formal computational models, but through the chance to use language in systems for automatic natural language processing.
background	The paper discusses these possibilities in detail, and then examines the actual work that has been done.
objective	It is evident that this has so far been primarily research within a new field, computational linguistics, which is largely motivated by the demands, and interest, of practical processing systems, and that information technology has had rather little influence on linguistics at large.
objective	There are different reasons for this, and not all good ones: information technology deserves more attention from linguists.

background	We consider learning representations of entities and relations in KBs using the neural-embedding approach.
objective	We show that most existing models, including NTN (Socher et al., 2013) and TransE (Bordes et al., 2013b), can be generalized under a unified learning framework, where entities are low-dimensional vectors learned from a neural network and relations are bilinear and/or linear mapping functions.
method	Under this framework, we compare a variety of embedding models on the link prediction task.
method	We show that a simple bilinear formulation achieves new state-of-the-art results for the task (achieving a top-10 accuracy of 73.2% vs. 54.7% by TransE on Freebase).
method	Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes the learned relation embeddings to mine logical rules such as BornInCitypa, bq ^ CityInCountrypb, cq ùñ Nationalitypa, cq.
result	We find that embeddings learned from the bilinear objective are particularly good at capturing relational semantics, and that the composition of relations is characterized by matrix multiplication.
result	More interestingly, we demonstrate that our embedding-based rule extraction approach successfully outperforms a state-ofthe-art confidence-based rule mining approach in mining horn rules that involve compositional reasoning.

background	The Bjøntegaard model is widely used to calculate the coding efficiency between different codecs.
background	However, this model might not be an accurate predictor of the true coding efficiency as it relies on PSNR measurements.
objective	Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to calculate the average coding efficiency based on subjective quality scores, i.e., mean opinion scores (MOS).
method	We call this approach Subjective Comparison of ENcoders based on fItted Curves (SCENIC).
method	To consider the intrinsic nature of bounded rating scales, a logistic function is used to fit the rate-distortion (R-D) values.
method	The average MOS and bit rate differences are computed between the fitted R-D curves.
method	The statistical property of subjective scores is considered to estimate corresponding confidence intervals on the calculated average MOS and bit rate differences.
result	The proposed model is expected to report more realistic coding efficiency as PSNR is not always correlated with perceived visual quality.

objective	This paper discusses empirical and analytical rules to select a suitable grid resolution for output maps and based on the inherent properties of the input data.
background	The choice of grid resolution was related with the cartographic and statistical concepts: scale, computer processing power, positional accuracy, size of delineations, inspection density, spatial autocorrelation structure and complexity of terrain.
method	These were further related with the concepts from the general statistics and information theory such as Nyquist frequency concept from signal processing and equations to estimate the probability density function.
method	Selection of grid resolution was demonstrated using four datasets: (1) GPS positioning data— the grid resolution was related to the area of circle described by the error radius, (2) map of agricultural plots—the grid resolution was related to the size of smallest and narrowest plots, (3) point dataset from soil mapping—the grid resolution was related to the inspection density, nugget variation and range of spatial autocorrelation and (4) contour map used for production of digital elevation model—the grid resolution was related with the spacing between the contour lines i.e. complexity of terrain.
method	It was concluded that no ideal grid resolution exists, but rather a range of suitable resolutions.
method	One should at least try to avoid using resolutions that do not comply with the effective scale or inherent properties of the input dataset.
method	Three standard grid resolutions for output maps were finally recommended: (a) the coarsest legible grid resolution—this is the largest resolution that we should use in order to respect the scale of work and properties of a dataset; (b) the finest legible grid resolution—this is the smallest grid resolution that represents 95% of spatial objects or topography; and (c) recommended grid resolution—a compromise between the two.
objective	Objective procedures to derive the true optimal grid resolution that maximizes the predictive capabilities or information content of a map are further discussed.
method	This methodology can now be integrated within a GIS package to help inexperienced users select a suitable grid resolution without doing extensive data preprocessing.

background	Bitcoin cryptocurrency demonstrated the utility of global consensus across thousands of nodes, changing the world of digital transactions forever.
background	In the early days of Bitcoin, the performance of its probabilistic proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus fabric, also known as blockchain, was not a major issue.
background	Bitcoin became a success story, despite its consensus latencies on the order of an hour and the theoretical peak throughput of only up to 7 transactions per second.
background	The situation today is radically different and the poor performance scalability of early PoW blockchains no longer makes sense.
method	Specifically, the trend of modern cryptocurrency platforms, such as Ethereum, is to support execution of arbitrary distributed applications on blockchain fabric, needing much better performance.
background	This approach, however, makes cryptocurrency platforms step away from their original purpose and enter the domain of database-replication protocols, notably, the classical state-machine replication, and in particular its Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) variants.
method	In this paper, we contrast PoW-based blockchains to those based on BFT state machine replication, focusing on their scalability limits.
method	We also discuss recent proposals to overcoming these scalability limits and outline key outstanding open problems in the quest for the “ultimate” blockchain fabric(s).

background	Potential consequences of disasters involve overwhelming economic losses, large affected populations and serious environmental damages.
background	Given these devastating effects, there is an increasing interest in developing measures in order to diminish the possible impact of disasters, which gave rise to the field of disaster operations management (DOM).
background	In this paper we review recent OR/MS research in DOM.
background	Our work is a continuation of a previous review from Altay and Green (2006).
objective	Our purpose is to evaluate how OR/MS research in DOM has evolved in the last years and to what extent the gaps identified by Altay and Green (2006) have been covered.
background	Our findings show no drastic changes or developments in the field of OR/MS in DOM since the publication of Altay and Green (2006).
method	Additionally to our comparative analysis, we present an original evaluation about the most common assumptions in recent OR/MS literature in DOM.
result	Based on our findings we provide future research directions in order to make improvements in the areas where lack of research is detected.

background	The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data.
method	Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors.
method	This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks.
method	This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.

objective	Email: harshitg@gatech.edu Summary Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object (eg, smart cameras, wearable, environmental sensors, home appliances, and vehicles) online, hence generating massive volume of data that can overwhelm storage systems and data analytics applications.
objective	Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements.
objective	However, there are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require low latency, and delay that is caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to the application can seriously impact their performances.
method	To overcome this limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network congestion.
method	To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed.
method	The first and most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput.
method	To this end, we need an evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a repeatable manner.
result	In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and cost.
method	We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT environment and comparison of resource management policies.

background	Probabilistic programming allows for automatic Bayesian inference on user-defined probabilistic models.
background	Recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling allow inference on increasingly complexmodels.
background	This class ofMCMC, known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, requires gradient information which is often not readily available.
background	PyMC3 is a new open source probabilistic programming framework written in Python that uses Theano to compute gradients via automatic differentiation as well as compile probabilistic programs on-the-fly to C for increased speed.
background	Contrary to other probabilistic programming languages, PyMC3 allows model specification directly in Python code.
method	The lack of a domain specific language allows for great flexibility and direct interaction with the model.

background	Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classification and regression analysis due to their solid mathematical foundations, which include two desirable properties: margin maximization and nonlinear classification using kernels.
background	However, despite these prominent properties, SVMs are usually not chosen for large-scale data mining problems because their training complexity is highly dependent on the data set size.
method	Unlike traditional pattern recognition and machine learning, real-world data mining applications often involve huge numbers of data records.
background	Thus it is too expensive to perform multiple scans on the entire data set, and it is also infeasible to put the data set in memory.
background	This paper presents a method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), that maximizes the SVM performance for very large data sets given a limited amount of resource, e.g., memory.
result	CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples.
result	These samples carry statistical summaries of the data and maximize the benefit of learning.
result	Our analyses show that the training complexity of CB-SVM is quadratically dependent on the number of support vectors, which is usually much less than that of the entire data set.
other	Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets and very accurate in terms of classification.

method	Automatic detection of pavement cracks is an important task in transportation maintenance for driving safety assurance.
objective	However, it remains a challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background, e.g., the low contrast with surrounding pavement and possible shadows with similar intensity.
background	Inspired by recent success on applying deep learning to computer vision and medical problems, a deep-learning based method for crack detection is proposed in this paper.
result	A supervised deep convolutional neural network is trained to classify each image patch in the collected images.
result	Quantitative evaluation conducted on a data set of 500 images of size 3264 χ 2448, collected by a low-cost smart phone, demonstrates that the learned deep features with the proposed deep learning framework provide superior crack detection performance when compared with features extracted with existing hand-craft methods.

background	ÐHidden Markov models (HMMs) are stochastic models capable of statistical learning and classification.
background	They have been applied in speech recognition and handwriting recognition because of their great adaptability and versatility in handling sequential signals.
background	On the other hand, as these models have a complex structure and also because the involved data sets usually contain uncertainty, it is difficult to analyze the multiple observation training problem without certain assumptions.
background	For many years researchers have used Levinson's training equations in speech and handwriting applications, simply assuming that all observations are independent of each other.
objective	This paper presents a formal treatment of HMM multiple observation training without imposing the above assumption.
method	In this treatment, the multiple observation probability is expressed as a combination of individual observation probabilities without losing generality.
method	This combinatorial method gives one more freedom in making different dependence-independence assumptions.
method	By generalizing Baum's auxiliary function into this framework and building up an associated objective function using the Lagrange multiplier method, it is proven that the derived training equations guarantee the maximization of the objective function.
result	Furthermore, we show that Levinson's training equations can be easily derived as a special case in this treatment.

background	Mobile technology has become increasingly common in today’s everyday life.
background	However, mobile payment is surprisingly not among the frequently used mobile services, although technologically advanced solutions exist.
background	Apparently, there is still a lack of acceptance of mobile payment services among consumers.
method	The conceptual model developed and tested in this research thus focuses on factors determining consumers’ acceptance of mobile payment services.
result	The empirical results show particularly strong support for the effects of compatibility, individual mobility, and subjective norm.
result	Our study offers several implications for managers in regards to marketing mobile payment solutions to increase consumers’ intention to use these services.

background	Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs.
result	Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks.
background	Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively.
method	In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results.
method	Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected.
result	In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network.
result	We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features.
result	A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.

background	Computer graphics research has concentrated on creating photo-realistic images of synthetic objects.
objective	These images communicate surface shading and curvature, as well as the depth relationships of objects in a scene.
method	These renderings are traditionally represented by a rectangular array of pixels that tile the image plane.
method	As an alternative to photo-realism, it is possible to create abstract images using an ordered collection of brush strokes.
result	These abstract images filter and refine visual information before it is presented to the viewer.
result	By controlling the color, shape, size, and orientation of individual brush strokes, impressionistic paintings of computer generated or photographic images can easily be created.

background	Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs.
background	Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort.
background	With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features.
background	However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank.
objective	In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems.
method	We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps.
result	Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models.
result	We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow.

method	The evolution and convergence properties of hybrid methods based on both sparsity and smoothness constraints for the resulting nonnegative matrix factors are discussed.
result	The interpretability of NMF outputs in specific contexts are provided along with opportunities for future work in the modification of NMF algorithms for large-scale and time-varying datasets.

background	Bitcoins have recently become an increasingly popular cryptocurrency through which users trade electronically and more anonymously than via traditional electronic transfers.
background	Bitcoin’s design keeps all transactions in a public ledger.
background	The sender and receiver for each transaction are identified only by cryptographic publickey ids.
background	This leads to a common misconception that it inherently provides anonymous use.
background	While Bitcoin’s presumed anonymity offers new avenues for commerce, several recent studies raise user-privacy concerns.
objective	We explore the level of anonymity in the Bitcoin system.
method	Our approach is two-fold: (i) We annotate the public transaction graph by linking bitcoin public keys to real people either definitively or statistically.
method	(ii) We run the annotated graph through our graph-analysis framework to find and summarize activity of both known and unknown users.

background	Hardware technologies for trusted computing, or trusted execution environments (TEEs), have rapidly matured over the last decade.
background	In fact, TEEs are at the brink of widespread commoditization with the recent introduction of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX).
background	Despite such rapid development of TEE, software technologies for TEE significantly lag behind their hardware counterpart, and currently only a select group of researchers have the privilege of accessing this technology.
objective	To address this problem, we develop an open source platform, called OpenSGX, that emulates Intel SGX hardware components at the instruction level and provides new system software components necessarily required for full TEE exploration.
method	We expect that the OpenSGX framework can serve as an open platform for SGX research, with the following contributions.
method	First, we develop a fully functional, instruction-compatible emulator of Intel SGX for enabling the exploration of software/hardware design space, and development of enclave programs.
method	OpenSGX provides a platform for SGX development, meaning that it provides not just emulation but also operating system components, an enclave program loader/packager, an OpenSGX user library, debugging, and performance monitoring.
result	Second, to show OpenSGX’s use cases, we applied OpenSGX to protect sensitive information (e.g., directory) of Tor nodes and evaluated their potential performance impacts.
result	Therefore, we believe OpenSGX has great potential for broader communities to spark new research on soon-to-becommodity Intel SGX.

background	Recently, increasing attention has been directed to the study of the emotional content of speech signals, and hence, many systems have been proposed to identify the emotional content of a spoken utterance.
background	This paper is a survey of speech emotion classification addressing three important aspects of the design of a speech emotion recognition system.
background	The first one is the choice of suitable features for speech representation.
background	The second issue is the design of an appropriate classification scheme and the third issue is the proper preparation of an emotional speech database for evaluating system performance.
background	Conclusions about the performance and limitations of current speech emotion recognition systems are discussed in the last section of this survey.
method	This section also suggests possible ways of improving speech emotion recognition systems.

background	Recurrent neural networks are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data, but the dependence of each timestep’s computation on the previous timestep’s output limits parallelism and makes RNNs unwieldy for very long sequences.
method	We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels.
method	Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size.
result	Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time.
result	Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.

background	Directed links in social media could represent anything from intimate friendships to common interests, or even a passion for breaking news or celebrity gossip.
background	Such directed links determine the flow of information and hence indicate a user’s influence on others—a concept that is crucial in sociology and viral marketing.
background	In this paper, using a large amount of data collected from Twitter, we present an in-depth comparison of three measures of influence: indegree, retweets, and mentions.
objective	Based on these measures, we investigate the dynamics of user influence across topics and time.
method	We make several interesting observations.
objective	First, popular users who have high indegree are not necessarily influential in terms of spawning retweets or mentions.
result	Second, most influential users can hold significant influence over a variety of topics.
method	Third, influence is not gained spontaneously or accidentally, but through concerted effort such as limiting tweets to a single topic.
result	We believe that these findings provide new insights for viral marketing and suggest that topological measures such as indegree alone reveals very little about the influence of a user.

background	Design thinking (DT) is regarded as a system of three overlapping spaces—viability, desirability, and feasibility—where innovation increases when all three perspectives are addressed.
background	Understanding how innovation within teams can be supported by DT methods and tools captivates the interest of business communities.
objective	This paper aims to examine how DT methods and tools foster innovation in teams.
result	A case study approach, based on two workshops, examined three DT methods with a software tool.

background	Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) models for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate.
background	Although significant effort has been dedicated to design and improve mobile models on all three dimensions, it is challenging to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider.
objective	In this paper, we propose an automated neural architecture search approach for designing resourceconstrained mobile CNN models.
objective	We propose to explicitly incorporate latency information into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency.
method	Unlike in previous work, where mobile latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), in our experiments, we directly measure real-world inference latency by executing the model on a particular platform, e.g., Pixel phones.
method	To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that permits layer diversity throughout the network.
result	Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks.
result	On the ImageNet classification task, our model achieves 74.0% top-1 accuracy with 76ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.5× faster than MobileNetV2 (Sandler et al. 2018) and 2.4× faster than NASNet (Zoph et al. 2018) with the same top-1 accuracy.
result	On the COCO object detection task, our model family achieves both higher mAP quality and lower latency than MobileNets.

background	This paper describes the implementation of general multibody system dynamics on Scissor lift Mechanism (i.e. four bar parallel mechanism) within a bond graph modeling framework.
method	Scissor lifting mechanism is the first choice for automobiles and industries for elevation work.
background	The system has a one degree of freedom.
method	There are several procedures for deriving dynamic equations of rigid bodies in classical mechanics (i.e. Classic Newton-D'Alembert, Newton-Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, kanes to name a few).
background	But these are labor-intensive for large and complicated systems thereby error prone.
method	Here the multibody dynamics model of the mechanism is developed in bond graph formalism because it offers flexibility for modeling of closed loop kinematic systems without any causal conflicts and control laws can be included.
method	In this work, the mechanism is modeled and simulated in order to evaluate several application-specific requirements such as dynamics, position accuracy etc.
method	The proposed multibody dynamics model of the mechanism offers an accurate and fast method to analyze the dynamics of the mechanism knowing that there is no such work available for scissor lifts.
result	The simulation gives a clear idea about motor torque sizing for different link lengths of the mechanism over a linear displacement.

background	Android is a modern and popular software platform for smartphones.
background	Among its predominant features is an advanced security model which is based on application-oriented mandatory access control and sandboxing.
background	This allows developers and users to restrict the execution of an application to the privileges it has (mandatorily) assigned at installation time.
background	The exploitation of vulnerabilities in program code is hence believed to be confined within the privilege boundaries of an application’s sandbox.
objective	However, in this paper we show that a privilege escalation attack is possible.
objective	We show that a genuine application exploited at runtime or a malicious application can escalate granted permissions.
result	Our results immediately imply that Android’s security model cannot deal with a transitive permission usage attack and Android’s sandbox model fails as a last resort against malware and sophisticated runtime attacks.
